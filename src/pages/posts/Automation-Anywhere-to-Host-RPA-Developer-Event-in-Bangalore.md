Automation Anywhere, a platform provider for Robotic Process Automation (RPA), will host a multi-level bot building competition — **Bot Games** — in Bangalore, India on September 18. The company’s enterprise-grade platform uses software bots that work side by side with people to do much of the repetitive work in many industries.

“*The driving motivation behind Bot Games is enabling technology professionals in the RPA industry to be successful in their careers,*” said **Rushabh Parmani**, Senior VP of Customer Success and Operations at Automation Anywhere. “*At Bot Games in Bengaluru, we will demonstrate again that learning and competing can be a lot of fun when done right.*”

RPA developers will compete in **Bot Wars**, a multi-level bot building competition that will test their ability to build functional, scalable and resilient bots.

The company is also hosting **Bot Genius**, a competition where developers submit working bots ahead of the event for a chance to showcase them to representatives from global enterprises, as well as promote them in the Automation Anywhere Bot Store. Prizes include a Volkswagen Polo GT car and more.

The company will also conduct a workshop on Automation Anywhere’s IQ Bot technology for cognitive automation developers and a competition to test their development skills. The event will also feature workshops on building reusable automation modules, and Automation Anywhere Bot Store, a marketplace for pre-built, plug and play bots.

After Bot Games, Automation Anywhere will host **Imagine**, its customer experience [event](https://www.automationanywhere.com/imagine-bengaluru), on September 19–20, 2018 in Bangalore.

Participation in Bot Games is free for qualified attendees — to participate, register [here.](https://www.automationanywhere.com/botgames)
