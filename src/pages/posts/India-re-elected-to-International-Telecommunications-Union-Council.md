India has been elected as a Member of the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) Council for another 4-year term (2019–2022). The elections to the Council were held during the ongoing ITU Plenipotentiary Conference 2018 at Dubai, UAE.

By securing 165 votes, India ranked third among the 13 countries elected to the Council from the Asia-Australasia region, and eighth among the 48 countries elected to the Council globally. The ITU has 193 member states who elect representatives to the Council. It is governed by the Plenipotentiary Conference which is the supreme organ of the Union and elects its senior officials, the 48 Members of its Council and its twelve members of the Radio Regulations Board.

“*India shares the dream and vision of ITU to realise the world as one nation and knowledge society*”, said **Manoj Sinha**, Union Minister of State for Communications (Independent Charge). “*Our strong partnership with the ITU is also demonstrated in the recent ITU decision to set up the* ***ITU South Asia Area Office and Technology Innovation Centre*** *in New Delhi.
