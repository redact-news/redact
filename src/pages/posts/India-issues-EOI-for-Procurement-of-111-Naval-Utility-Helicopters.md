These helicopters will replace Chetak Helicopters and will be utilised for Search and Rescue (SAR), Casualty evacuation (CASEVAC), low intensity maritime operations (LIMO), passenger roles and torpedo drops. The case was approved by Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) on 25 Aug 18.

The OEMs have been mandated to set up dedicated manufacturing line, including design, integration and manufacturing processes for NUH in India and make Indian Manufacturing Line a global exclusive facility for the NUH platform being offered.

The Indian companies would be shortlisted based on their capability of system of system integration, facility in the aerospace domain and financial capability.

The Request for EoI from Indian private companies for participating in the project has been hosted on the MoD and Indian Navy website while the Request for EoI from foreign OEMs has been forwarded to companies that participated in the RFI deliberations. The Indian companies have been given two months to respond to the EoI, while the foreign OEMs have been given three months for responding due to the nature of inputs required.
