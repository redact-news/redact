BAE Systems will showcase its participation in Team Tempest at Aero India 2019 in Bangalore. The UK is expected to invite India to co-develop this sixth-generation stealth fighter, which is proposed to be in service by 2035.

British Ministry of Defence (MoD) officials along with executives from BAE Systems are expected to brief Indian MoD and Indian Air Force officials on the project.

Team Tempest is the UK’s technology development programme being delivered by the Royal Air Force and industry partners to ensure a future international combat air system. It refers to a consortium consisting of the UK Ministry of Defence, BAE Systems, Rolls-Royce, Leonardo S.p.A. and MBDA.

Team Tempest brings together the UK’s industry and sovereign capabilities across future combat air’s four key technology areas: combat air systems and integration; power and propulsion systems; sensors, electronics and avionics; and weapon systems. Team Tempest was first revealed at the 2018 Farnborough International Air Show in July last year.

Leading the Company’s participation at the Show will be **Dave Armstrong**, Group Business Development Director, and **Nik Khanna**, India, Managing Director. Attending the Show will be Military Advisor, **Air Chief Marshal Sir Andrew Pulford**, amongst others.

“*Aero India is an important event on our international calendar, providing an excellent platform to engage with customers, partners, suppliers, and other key stakeholders, in this strategic market. With these future-focused displays, our emphasis at the Show will be to explore opportunities to collaborate with the entire breadth of our Indian partner spectrum, including the MSME sector,*” said **Dave Armstrong**, Group Business Development Director.

“*We are unveiling some of our finest future-tech solutions to the Indian Armed Forces at Aero India this year. The Show serves as a fertile ground for us to expand our efforts in expanding MSMEs into our global supply chain ecosystem whilst engaging with our key stakeholders, providing both direction and momentum in our plans. Developing an in-country supply chain is key to our India commitment and we are delighted to see this being galvanised through the commencement of the Make-in-India M777 programme,*” said **Nik Khanna**, Managing Director, India.

“*A big cost driver for a futuristic aerospace system is going to be the requirement for more and more software engineers. India has a huge capability in that area,*” Nik Khanna was quoted as saying by the Business Standard.

BAE Systems will also showcase the Eurofighter Typhoon; advanced electronic systems (APKWS© laser-guided rocket); augmented reality technology (Striker® II head-mounted display (HMD); and the Make-in-India Hawk132, of which 123 are in service with the Indian Air Force and the Indian Navy.

BAE Systems’ will also showcase its design and development capabilities of hard body armor solutions with Body Armour Vest and Body Armour Plate. Also marking its debut at the Show will be its Advanced Combat Helmet.

The Show follows shortly after the Company has marked several delivery milestones in the U.S. Government’s sale of 145 M777 Ultra Lightweight Howitzers (ULH) to the Indian Army. Most recently, the M777 ULH was inducted into the Indian Army, and consequently made its debut at the Republic Day Parade. Earlier in 2018, the Company delivered the first spares and other logistics including tooling, technical publications and training materials, to support the Indian Army as it brings the new M777 ULHs into service. BAE Systems is building and delivering the first 25 M777 ULHs fully assembled, and then to promote local economic growth in India, the remaining 120 systems will be assembled in India by Mahindra Defence Systems Ltd. (MDSL) under an arrangement designed to support defence industrial cooperation.

With India as the largest operator of the Hawk advanced jet trainer with 123 aircraft ordered to date by the Indian Air Force (106) and the Indian Navy (17), the Make-in-India Hawk will find position of pride on the Stand, alongside Eurofighter Typhoon, the world’s most advanced new generation multi-role/swing-role combat aircraft available in the market. In December 2017, Qatar became the ninth export customer to choose the Typhoon.

BAE Systems is located in Hall C, Stand 3.5 at Aero India 2019 in Bangalore, India.
