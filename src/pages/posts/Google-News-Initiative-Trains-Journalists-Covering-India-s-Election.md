The Google News Initiative, in partnership with DataLeads and Internews, recently conducted a training series to support journalists covering India’s elections. The trainings are happening in 30 cities across the country from 1st March to 6th April 2019 in English and regional languages (Hindi, Malayalam, Bangla, Kannada, Gujarati, Odia, Tamil, Telugu, Marathi).

The focus was on online verification and fact-checking, digital safety and security for journalists, YouTube for elections coverage and data visualisation for elections. A day-long training session was conducted in Bangalore on 8th March.

The 2019 Indian general election is scheduled to be held in 7 phases from 11 April 2019 to 19 May 2019 to constitute the 17th Lok Sabha. The counting of votes will be conducted on 23 May 2019 and on the same day the results will be declared. Legislative Assembly elections in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Odisha and Sikkim will be held simultaneously with the general election.[¹](#41d9)

Journalists were encouraged to use YouTube Live for election coverage as it has better discoverability on the platform, a live badge and the likelihood of editing and tampering is minimal. Viewers are also more likely to trust live streams more than edited versions that subsequently get forwarded on social media. It’s relatively easy to go live on YouTube from a mobile device (Frame the Shot, Test the Audio, Check the Signal). A 15-minute live video, when Brexit was announced, garnered 200,000 views in 24 hours for ‘*The Young Turks*’ YouTube channel.

According to Bharath Gangadharan, YouTube Partner Manager at Google, Youtube has 250 million monthly active users (MAU) in India and 60 percent of watch time on YouTube is from outside the six top cities. AajTaj, ABP and IndiaTV are the worlds largest YouTube channels, with over 10 million subscribers.

Abinay Kranthi, Data Analyst at Google (Google Trust & Safety), spoke about the ground rules for digital safety and security. In addition to simple checks to identify [phishing](http://G.co/phishingquiz), journalists were encouraged to use Google’s [Advanced Protection Program](http://g.co/AdvancedProtection) and two factor authentication. News organisations were encouraged to use [Project Shield](http://g.co/shield), a free service that uses Google technology (where all incoming traffic routed through Google infrastructure) to protect news and election sites from DDoS attacks. A DDoS attack is a simple and inexpensive way to take a website offline. It can be used to target critical, investigative work, silence journalism and stop freedom of information during elections.

Geetika Rustagi, Teaching Fellow at Optimum Info System Private Limited (Google News Labs), gave guidelines on data visualization for elections using Sheets, Maps and Trends from Google along with [Flourish](https://flourish.studio)[²](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScWIg13LEP_KGvDuypoVc4o38gP3CLDuLOhXsMWHwV7r0vBEA/viewform) and Tilegrams.

#### Tips for Video Verification

*   Always download the videos you are fact-checking
*   Archive the URL of the posts that include the video
*   Use YouTube, Facebook and Twitter like search engines
*   Often messages you receive on WhatsApp are posted with the same message to Facebook and Twitter
*   Search with the text of the message often leads you to the video on other platforms
*   If the reverse image search suggestion is not helpful, type keywords.
*   Reverse image search + key words = Powerful verification tool

#### Clues to watchout for in a photo or video

*   Building, Landmarks : Topography can be cross referenced using satellite maps or [Google Earth](https://earth.google.com/studio/docs/tutorials/)
*   Insignia : Flags, logo, emblems, badges help identify a region or a particular group
*   Comments : On social media chances are there’s always and in-house Sherlock that will point out inconsistencies
*   Number Plate : Vehicle registration plates can help you quickly pin point a geographical location
*   Weather : Pay attention to the weather in an image. This can be cross referenced with weather reports of a particular day
*   Clothing/Language : Clothing and language can act as cultural, religion or geographical identifier
*   Signage : Text on sign post, banners and billboards help to find a location. Phone number of a business can lead to a physical address.

#### Other reverse image search options

*   Yandex : Russian Search Engine
*   Baidu : Chinese Search Engine
*   TinEye : Reverse Image Search
*   RevEye : Reverse Image Search

#### Reverse Video Search

*   Youtube DataViewer by Amnesty International (goo.gl/78RSg9) displays YouTube metadata and enables reverse image search on thumbnails generated from the video.
*   InVID : A verification Plugin for both images and videos. The InVID project develops a video verification platform to detect emerging stories and assess the reliability of video content spread via social media

#### InVID

*   Web-based application of advanced video verification tools
*   Enhanced metadata viewer of YouTube, Facebook and Twitter videos
*   Retrieve contextual information such as location (if detected), interesting comments, licence rights , key frames and — YouTube thumbnails of videos.
*   Extract still frames from videos and apply a reverse image search using Google and non-English search engines such as Yandex and Baidu.
*   Useful features like Magnifier, Twitter Advanced Search and Image verification assistant.

#### Best Practices

*   All user-generated content (UGC) photos have to be fact-checked
*   Always archive the post you are fact-checking (Internet Archive Wayback Machine, Archive.is)
*   If Google’s ‘best guess’ isn’t helpful, try changing the text
*   Always try to find the original uploader. Stock image websites, media houses with their own photo desks and wire-agencies are usually reliable sources
*   Finding EXIF data is rare but always a plus.
