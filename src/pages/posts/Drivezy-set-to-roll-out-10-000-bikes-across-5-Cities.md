Bangalore-based vehicle sharing marketplace, Drivezy, announced today that it has added 10,000 bikes onto the platform. The company will launch the bikes across Bangalore, Hyderabad, Mysore, Mangalore and Manipal.

With the addition of the new fleet, the company plans to launch a one-way two-wheeler rental service, that will allow customers to rent a scooter or a motorcycle from a location and drop it any other company location as per their convenience.

Over the last one year, Drivezy has enlisted more than 4,000 two-wheelers in a bid to increase their footprint across the nation. Customers can rent vehicles from Drivezy on hourly, daily or monthly basis.

Founded in 2015, the company offers car, motorcycle and scooter sharing services across 9 cities in India. It recently announced a $20M Series B funding and a $100M asset financing deal with Anypay, under which the company will induct over 50,000 vehicles.

“*The global car-centric culture has burdened our cities with much unpleasantness, from traffic to parking shortages. The beauty of one-way two-wheeler rentals is that scooters and bikes can whisk you across congested urban roads for a few rupees. The sharing economy in India is thriving and has picked up the real pace in the past five years, especially within the mobility sector. With less than 8% of Indian citizens owning a car, the rapidly growing car and bike sharing industry could provide convenient and sustainable mobility to millions of urban Indian residents,*” said CEO and Co-Founder, **Ashwarya Pratap Singh**.

Earlier, Drivezy had launched a ‘last mile’ commute service for Hyderabad metro passengers with ‘per minute tariffs’. The rationale behind ‘last mile connectivity’ using bikes and scooters is to simplify travel for metro commuters who face difficulties in reaching their final destination from metro stations.

Unlike the conventional round-trip rental services, one-way rentals will absolve the customer from returning the vehicle at the point of origin. This will provide a greater degree of convenience and flexibility. This will allow customers to travel at half the price of cabs and offer economical options for last-mile connectivity across India.

The company is aggressively scaling its bike and scooter rental divisions which have added 3,000 scooters in Bangalore and Hyderabad this year under a partnership with Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India Pvt. Ltd. Additionally, Drivezy has partnered with Oyo and Ola in Hyderabad and is looking at similar partnerships in the near future to expand the bike and car rental space.

Drivezy (formerly JustRide) was selected by Y Combinator for the 2016 summer batch. It is also backed by Google. Drivezy has partnered with over 2,000 vehicle owners and has over 7,000 operational cars, motorcycles and scooters on its platform, which are rented by over 37,000 customers every month.
