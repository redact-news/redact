Esri, a maker of geographic information system (GIS) software, has opened its latest research and development centre in New Delhi, India. The new location will focus on data science, deep learning, and geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI) solutions for spatial analytics.

This is the company’s fifteenth R&D centre. Recently, Esri opened an R&D centre in Vienna, Austria — announced as part of the company’s acquisition of indoor positioning system (IPS) provider indoo.rs — that is focused on developing cutting-edge IPS capabilities. It also has R&D centres in Beijing, China and Zurich, Switzerland.
