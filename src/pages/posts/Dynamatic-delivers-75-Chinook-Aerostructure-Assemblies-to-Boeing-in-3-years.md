Boeing \[NYSE: BA\] and Dynamatic Technologies have announced the delivery of the 75th aft pylon and cargo ramp components for Boeing’s H-47 Chinook heavy-lift helicopter. Dynamatic Technologies had delivered the first set of aft pylon and cargo ramp assemblies for the Chinook in February 2015.

Dynamatic Technologies Limited¸ a $265 million company, manufactures critical components for the H-47 Chinook, a multi-mission, heavy-lift transport helicopter. The aerostructures are integrated at Boeing’s facility in Philadelphia.

As Boeing is expanding its engagement with India’s Ministry of Defence, the company is taking its commitment to ‘*Make in India*’ seriously. In addition to the 22 Apache and 15 Chinook helicopters on order for the Indian air Force, the Indian Air Force and Indian Navy are operating C-17 strategic airlifters and P-8I long-range maritime reconnaissance and anti-submarine aircraft.

“*This delivery marks a significant milestone in the success of the Make in India program and our commitment towards building indigenous manufacturing capabilities,*” said **Pratyush Kumar**, President, Boeing India. “*We established the Chinook production line in 2014 as part of our commitment to manufacture aerospace aerostructures in India and Dynamatic has been our key partner in that journey. The future of advanced manufacturing in India looks promising.*”

This first delivery of the aft pylon in February 2015 was mentioned by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at his inaugural address at the Aero India exhibition in 2015.

“*This is a remarkable milestone in our partnership with Boeing and the Chinook program to deliver high quality aerospace products from India,*” said **Udayant Malhoutra,** CEO & Managing Director, Dynamatic Technologies Ltd. “*We are manufacturing complex assemblies for global OEMs and have become an integral part of the worldwide supply chain, incorporating globally accepted standards of aerospace manufacturing in our facilities.*”

The Chinook is a multi-role, vertical-lift platform, emphasizing heavy-lift transport of troops, artillery, equipment, and fuel. It is used for humanitarian disaster-relief operations, in missions such as transportation of relief supplies and mass evacuation of refugees.

Boeing currently employs 1,200 people in India, and more than 7000 people work with its supply chain partners. Boeing has been sourcing from suppliers in India for over two decades in manufacturing, IT and engineering services. Now, there are more than 160 suppliers providing advanced, complex components and subassemblies for Boeing commercial and defense aircraft as part of an integrated global supply chain.

The company’s annual sourcing from India stands at $1 billion. These parts and assemblies cover critical components such as aerostructures, wire harnesses, composites, forgings, avionics mission systems and ground support equipment for aircraft that include the 777, 787, P-8, F/A-18 Super Hornet, F-15 and H-47 Chinook.
