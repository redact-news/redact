To put in place an institutionalised structure for effectively building the capacity and infrastructure for handling cybercrime investigations, Criminal Investigation Department, Karnataka State in collaboration with Infosys Foundation, the philanthropic arm of Infosys and Data Security Council of India (Initiative of NASSCOM) has setup a Centre for Cybercrime Investigation Training & Research (CCITR) at CID Headquarters, Bangalore.

The centre is setup as part of the Memorandum of Understanding(MoU) signed by CID Karnataka, Infosys Foundation and Data Security Council of India (DSCI) on 03rd October 2018 at Vidhana Soudha in the presence of the Home Minister of Karnataka.

As part of this collaboration, the Infosys Foundation will provide the funding support to the tune of 22 Crore INR towards setup costs including capital investment for hardware, software and working capital requirements, associated facility management and operational costs over a period of five years.

Data Security of India(DSCI) has been running the training facility at CID Headquarters, Bangalore for the last 12 years. The features included in the centre are Resource centre for Digital Forensics, Research & Development and collaboration with national & international organizations working in Digital Forensics domain.

Government of Karnataka realised very early the need for having a separate workforce to handle cybercrimes by setting up the country’s First Cybercrime police station in CID Headquarters, Bangalore. Recently, CEN (Cyber, Economic Offences & Narcotics) police stations have been setup and made operational in all districts of Karnataka.

In 2007 South India’s first Cybercrime & Cyber forensics training facility (Cyber Lab) was set up in collaboration with NASSCOM & DSCI. Over 17,000 personnel from police, prosecution, judiciary, defense forces and others have been benefitted through regular training and outreach programs.

The CCITR aims to build capacity of police, prosecution, judiciary and other departments in handling technology investigations and create standard operating procedures (SOPs) in cybercrime investigations. The centre will also involve in research related to legal, technical and procedural aspects of cybercrime investigation. The centre will work towards in improving the investigation and prosecution of cybercrime cases in Karnataka.

“*We believe there exists a variety of opportunities for increased collaboration on cybercrime capacity-building, research and development, combating cybercrime, international best practices and CID intends to pursue an array of follow-on activities to bolster the partnership with the IT industry and achieve concrete outcomes. The Centre for Cybercrime Investigation Training & Research (CCITR) is equipped with state-of-the-art Cyber forensics investigation and training facility and would serve as a regional hub for any cybercrime related capability building efforts in the entire state of Karnataka. I’m sure the partnership with Infosys foundation and DSCI would help streamline our efforts both the short and long term, to improve the handling of cybercrime cases in Karnataka,*” said **Praveen Sood**, IPS, DGP, CID.

“*Ever increasing cybercrimes and data breaches have been a concern for the citizens, government and industry in India. Capacity building — including resource mobilization, training and sharing of best practices are essential for enabling the law enforcement capacities in dealing with technical investigations. The setting up of Centre for Cybercrime Investigation Training and Research is one very important step in that direction. Infosys Foundation is proud to be associated with CID Karnataka and Data Security Council of India for this project,*” said **Sudha Murty**, Chairperson, Infosys Foundation.

“*Our commitment to help build the capabilities of law enforcement is reinforced with the scaling up of cyber lab facility to Centre for Cybercrime Investigation Training and Research. This centre is aimed to act as perfect Public — private — partnership collaboration platform to accelerate technology research growth in cyber forensics domain and build capacity of Police, Prosecution and Judiciary in handling criminal cases involving complex technologies. The centre will also focus on establishing professional linkages with experts from industry, academia at national and global level. DSCI acknowledges the vital support received from CID Karnataka and Infosys Foundation to make this happen and looks forward to their continued cooperation,*” said **Rama Vedashree**, Chief Executive Officer of Data Security Council of India (DSCI)
