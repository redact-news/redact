“*Blockchain is gradually becoming a vital social infrastructure, similar to the Internet, and enables a more connected and equitable world. At Emurgo Academy, our vision is to empower all organizations and developers to build global solutions embracing blockchain technology towards a better future. We believe that education is the first step towards fulfilling that vision. We are sure that at least 2,500 graduates of Emurgo Academy’s blockchain courses will go on to be hired in the first year by some of the country’s largest and most innovative organizations, thus serving to meet the gap in demand for quality blockchain developers,*” said **E Venkatesan**, Chief Executive Officer, Emurgo Academy.

Emurgo was registered in Tokyo, Japan in June 2017 and in Singapore in May 2018. Emurgo is uniquely affiliated and works closely with IOHK to grow Cardano’s ecosystem globally and promote the adoption of the Cardano blockchain.

“*Over the past few years, we have been witnessing an ever-increasing demand in the Indian marketplace for blockchain developers and experts. Out of the 4 million IT workforce in India, approximately 1.5 million of them are based in Bangalore. I am delighted with the launch of Emurgo Academy in the city and that will provide a platform to connect developers and organizations, enabling them learn the technology and implement it in their own business verticals. This will definitely open up better and newer opportunities for job aspirants in this field,*” said **Dr. K R Venugopal**, Vice Chancellor, Bangalore University.

“*India has always taken the lead in the IT domain, whether in Product Development or Management. With the largest pool of talent graduating every year, we see a large potential to train these college students and professionals to become Blockchain developers. Our plan is to be present in at least 200 institutions where we see upskilling and teach Blockchain as an opportunity,*” said **Manmeet Singh**, Chief Investment Officer, Emurgo. “*In India, the IT has a market size of US $160 billion and is projected to more than double to US $350 billion by 2025. The Indian IT industry employs 4 million workers with nearly half comprised of software developers. Yet, of the 2 million software developers in India, only 5,000 or a quarter of one percent (0.25%) possess the necessary blockchain development skills.*”

“*The programs have been designed to target the need to upskill or reskill working professionals, under graduates and freshers looking for jobs using blockchain technology. All working professionals will be required to take a self-assessment test to evaluate their eligibility for the Executive Program while IT programming developers will need minimum of two years’ work experience alongside knowledge of Javascript/Python/C or C++. The entire curriculum of the Academy is based on a hybrid model with a mix of online and offline training strategy with SMEs as part of the trainer pool along with external consultants with industry exposure. The students will also be evaluated by CXOs to help them understand better the kind of tools that should be used in a particular architecture,*” read a communiqué from the company.
