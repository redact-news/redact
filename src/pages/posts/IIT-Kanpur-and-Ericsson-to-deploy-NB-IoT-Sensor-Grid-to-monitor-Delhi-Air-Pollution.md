The Indian Institute of Kanpur (IIT Kanpur) and Ericsson have signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to deploy a NB-IoT based sensor network to monitor air pollution in Delhi.

As part of the MoU, Ericsson will use locally developed air quality sensors that are capable of sharing environmental data including PM1, PM2.5 and PM10 levels at defined time intervals. This will lead to better monitoring and analysis of data collected from different parts of the capital.

“The air pollution levels in Delhi is an issue that needs to be tracked and addressed on a continuous basis. In partnership with IIT Kanpur, NB-IoT based-sensors will be deployed at strategic locations in the city. The sensors are automated and will relay information on defined time intervals, providing data on pollution levels, sources and locations in a sustainable and cost-efficient way,” said Nitin Bansal, Head of Ericsson India.

The findings will be shared with local authorities and other key stakeholders on a periodic basis. The partnership will also include working with community-based organisations to raise awareness regarding air pollution and steps that can be taken to reduce it.

“With support from Ericsson we will develop and deploy India’s first NB -IoT based low cost Particulate Matter sensors at multiple locations across Delhi. The collection and analysis of this data can be of crucial help in addressing the menace of air pollution,” said Prof. S. Tripathi, Head of Department, Civil Engineering at IIT Kanpur.

The air quality in Delhi, the capital of India, according to a WHO survey of 1600 world cities, is the worst of any major city in the world. India’s Ministry of Earth Sciences published a research paper in October 2018 attributing almost 41% of PM2.5 air pollution in Delhi to vehicular emissions, 21.5% to dust and 18% to industries. In November 2017, in an event known as the Great smog of Delhi, the air pollution spiked far beyond acceptable levels.
