Naini Aerospace Limited (NAeL), the Naini (Prayagraj) Unit of sick Hindustan Cables Limited which was closed for nearly 15 years before being taken over by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, has started producing helicopter structures and sub-assemblies for HAL’s Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH Dhruv). Currently, the NAeL is executing the HAL order for five sets of ALH (Dhruv) structural assemblies.

HAL’s Helicopter Division in Bangalore received the first batch of helicopter structures and sub-assemblies manufactured by NAeL. The ‘Certificate of Conformity’ of sub-assemblies and bottom structure assembly was formally handed over yesterday at a function in Naini.

R. Madhavan, CMD, HAL had recently launched the structural assembly shop for production of helicopter structures. The quality management system has been cleared by a joint audit team of DGAQA and HAL for manufacturing of aircraft loom and structural assembly.

V. Natarajan, Executive Director, Helicopter Division-HAL received the documents from R.K Mishra, CEO (NAeL). Jig-out of bottom structure of ALH was performed by GVS Bhaskar, CEO-HC and Shekhar Shrivastava, CEO-BC, HAL inaugurated the Gate Complex of NAeL in separate events.

After being taken over by HAL last year, the ageing manpower of Hindustan Cables Limited was absorbed in the company and was provided extensive training for acquiring necessary skills in aerospace sector. The infrastructure for aero-structures and aircraft loom manufacturing was created in one year, apart from repairs, renovation, securing factory license, statutory taxation, labour and EPFO registrations required for production and business operations.

V.M. Chamola, Director (HR)-HAL and Chairman (NAeL) hailed the efforts of NAeL employees in acquiring skills in the difficult domain of manufacturing of aero-structures. “With the handing-over of helicopter structures, NAeL has now developed capabilities in the field of aero-structures apart from aircraft loom manufacturing,” he added.

The company commenced production activities of wire harnesses of helicopter and aircraft in July 2017 within a time frame of five months after being taken over. The company had earlier made its maiden delivery of aircraft looms to HAL on March 27, 2018. It has so far manufactured over 600 aircraft looms for ALH Dhruv and LCA Tejas aircraft.
