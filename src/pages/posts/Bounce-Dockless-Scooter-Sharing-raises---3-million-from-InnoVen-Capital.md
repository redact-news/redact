Bounce, a dockless two-wheeler rental service provider, has recently raised USD 3 million as venture debt from InnoVen Capital. The funds will be used to further boost Bounce’s expansion plans and establish a pan-India presence.

Bounce had raised $ 12 million from Sequoia Capital and Accel Ventures in August. Bounce plans to add 10,000 scooters in the next 6 months and increase its fleet size to 30,000 by 2020.

Founded by Vivekananda, Varun Agni and Anil G in 2014, Bounce (formerly Metro Bikes) offers a dockless scooter sharing service allowing users to pick up the scooter from anywhere, ride to their destination and drop it off at any location. The company offers premium motorcycles on rent under the Wicked Ride label.

The company’s mobility solution is tackling the last mile connectivity challenges faced by Indian commuters. Bounce commenced operations in Hyderabad last month with 500 scooters. It has around 2,000 vehicles in Bangalore. The company also launched bicycles and electric cycles called pedelecs recently. It plans to introduce kick scooters across the city.

The average cost per km is around INR 6 for a Bounce user. With most intra-city commute being sub 5 km, the service is already seeing massive adoption. So far, the company has seen over 250k downloads on its android & iOS platforms.

“*We are delighted to have partnered with Innoven. We are particularly impressed with the team’s expertise, understanding of our business, industry knowledge and quick turnaround. We believe that InnoVen’s global presence and excellent network will help us to expand our footprint and accelerate our growth,*’’ said **Vivekananda HR**, Co-Founder, Bounce.

“*Bounce is creating a very interesting and useful category for last mile commute in Indian cities, characterised by dense population, infrastructural issues and lack of convenient and affordable commuting options. The shared mobility segment has tremendous potential and Bounce’s innovative offering in the two wheeler segment is well poised to fill a critical void for Indian commuters. InnoVen is very excited to be part of this ride with Bounce,*” said **Ankit Agarwal**, Director at InnoVen Capital.
