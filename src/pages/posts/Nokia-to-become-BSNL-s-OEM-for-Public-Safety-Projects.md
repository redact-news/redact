India’s state-owned telecom service provider Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) and Nokia have entered into an agreement under which Nokia will become BSNL’s Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) technology partner for public safety projects.

Under the agreement Nokia and BSNL will explore public safety opportunities for various industry segments including Smart City deployment, border-related activities, and mines and quarries in remote areas with limited connectivity. In addition, they will establish a mission-critical government network, allowing ministers and other officials to communicate securely across the country. The companies will also work with the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) to help them leverage the benefits of LTE technology in public safety communications systems.

Often during a disaster situation communications networks can be hampered, impacting relief and rescue efforts. A reliable and robust LTE public safety system is therefore critical in these situations to aid public safety workers. Leveraging the Nokia ViTrust critical communications portfolio, in particular the Nokia Ultra Compact Network, Nokia and BSNL will explore solutions that help first responders more swiftly locate people and assist affected communities. The Nokia Ultra Compact Network (UCN) is a portable solution that allows first responders to set up a reliable mission-critical mobile broadband network in minutes. By establishing an LTE network, first responders can securely transmit large images and videos in real-time to other workers and command centers, providing vital insight into a situation to aid public safety and rescue efforts.

“*As a trusted telecom service provider, BSNL is committed to providing the best technology solutions for public safety professionals. Our technology partnership with Nokia is a crucial step in this direction. We have a longstanding working relationship with Nokia, and this project starts a new chapter in our journey. Nokia’s innovation and leadership in mission-critical communications will allow us to deliver a best-in-class public safety network,*” said **Anupam Srivastava**, Chairman and Managing Director at BSNL.

“*We have been working closely with BSNL for more than 25 years and this agreement further strengthens our relationship. This is the first time our public safety solution will be used in India, and we are excited to leverage our ViTrust critical communications portfolio, working with BSNL to enhance public safety work and aid vital rescue operations,*” said **J P Singh**, head of Nokia’s customer team for the Government Business in India.
