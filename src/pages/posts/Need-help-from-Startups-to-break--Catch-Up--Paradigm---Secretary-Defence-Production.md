Ajay Kumar, Secretary, Department of Defence Production, on Monday, said that the present indigenisation process, that placed the country in a continuous ‘catch-up’ paradigm, would need the help of start-ups to be disrupted by indigenous innovation.

“*Defence Innovation Unit in U.S. is recognition of the fact that the future of the Defence industry is going to be in the hands of startups. In India we are fortunate that we have the worlds third largest ecosystem,*” said Dr. Ajay Kumar, Secretary, Department of Defence Production. “*Israel has shown the world what startups have created. U.S. has realised this now.*”

“*At the macro level, we are playing catch-up. We import technology, we try to indigenise and by the time we indigenise, the new one has already come. This is the limitation of the present system,*” he said.

“*For the T72 and T90 tanks we were importing 760 HP and 1000 HP engines. Once these engines were indigenised by the Ordinance Factory Board the price came down to 40 per cent of the import price. However, if the T72 needs to be upgraded with 1000 HP engines, we have to go for a fresh ToT (Transfer of Technology) so that the 1000 HP engine can be fitted into T72, since the form-factor is different. This situation needs to change,*” said Dr. Ajay Kumar.

Citing the case of CK Varghese, a mechanical engineering student from Kerala, who is developing a rifle, he said that the Defence Investor Cell is here to help young entrepreneurs. The Defence Investor Cell put him across to the Army Design Bureau, which looked at his work and gave him insights for further improvement. CK Varghese filed his fourth patent after that.

Cautioning start-ups not to give up too early, he gave the example of Richard Jordan Gatling, an American inventor best known for his invention of the Gatling gun, whose automatic weapon took 4 years to be introduced in the armed forces.

“*More and more technology in Defence is being determined by software. This is where we can offer features that are better than the best. The world is moving from Automatic (event triggered) to Automated (rule based algorithms) to Autonomous (goal oriented). Autonomy based systems is providing a whole range of opportunities for startups,*” said Dr. Ajay Kumar.

#### 31 Projects approved under DPP Make II

Sanjay Jaju, Joint Secretary, DoDP, and CEO, IDeX, said that 31 projects had been accorded in-principle approval under Make II of the DPP. “*Many of them have already moved up the value chain,*” he said.

“*The Make II is and Industry funded scheme. Speed under it is faster than any other make projects that have happened. In 6 to 7 months, 31 projects were given in principle approval and are moving forward with assurance of order. It has a sub-category for suo-moto proposals. We have now approved 2 such proposals and 12 more are under consideration,*” said Dr. Ajay Kumar.
