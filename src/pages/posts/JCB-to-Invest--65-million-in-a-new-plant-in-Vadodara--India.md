JCB has unveiled plans to invest £65 million in a new plant in India. The new factory will be located in Vadodara near the port city of Surat in the State of Gujarat on the West Coast of India and will fabricate parts for global production lines as the company prepares to meet increased demand.

JCB Chairman Lord Bamford (on Monday, March 25th) laid the foundation stone for the new plant which will be JCB’s sixth in India.

India has been JCB’s biggest single market since 2007. JCB India already has factories in Delhi, Pune and Jaipur. Production at the new facility on a 44 acre site will begin next year. It will house the most modern laser cutting, welding and machining technology and will be a fork-lift free operation. It will be capable of processing 85,000 tonnes of steel annually.

“*With major investment in manufacturing capacity in the UK and India, we are very well placed to grow our business in the future. This year we celebrate 40 years of JCB India and our success over those four decades is down to our continual investment. It’s fitting that we mark the 40th anniversary with an investment in a factory which will give us enormous manufacturing capacity,*” said **Lord Bamford**.

“*For 40 years JCB has remained committed to India. The decision to build a new world-class factory at Vadodara builds on JCB’s commitment to India. The chosen site is strategically important because it is located close to a major sea port which allows efficient transportation,*” said JCB India MD **Vipin Sondhi**.

The announcement follows the start of work on a new £50 million factory to build cabs for JCB machines in Uttoxeter, Staffordshire which will be completed later this year. Work is under way on a 350,000 sq ft facility for JCB Cab Systems adjacent to the A50 in Uttoxeter, Staffordshire, next to two existing JCB plants. The hi-tech factory will have the capacity to produce around 100,000 cabs a year. It will include a computer controlled production line, fully-automated painting facility and robotic welding and will create more than 200 new jobs by 2022.
