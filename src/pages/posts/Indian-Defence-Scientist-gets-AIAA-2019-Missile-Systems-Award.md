Dr. G. Satheesh Reddy, Chairman of the Defence Research and Development Organization, Ministry of Defence, India, was selected for his over three decades of significant national contributions toward indigenous design, development, and deployment of diversified strategic and tactical missile systems, guided weapons, advanced avionics, and navigation technologies in India. Dr. Reddy will receive his award in India.

The award recognises excellence in developing or implementing missile systems technology, including significant technological accomplishments or for inspired leadership of missile systems programs.

The award will be presented during the AIAA Defense Forum, held 7–9 May at the Kossiakoff Center at Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland.

The AIAA Missile Systems Technical Committee presents the award biennially to a candidate who has demonstrated expertise in fundamental technical disciplines that has led to substantial improvement in missile systems or innovative leadership that has established an environment in which creativity in missile system technology implementation can flourish and which led to the successful completion of a major program milestone by a government agency or an industry team.

“Rondell J. Wilson, retired Principal Engineering Fellow of Raytheon Missile Systems in Tucson, Arizona, was selected for his exemplary technical leadership and innovation that has significantly advanced the performance and capability of the world’s premier missile defense systems,” read a communiqué from AIAA.

The American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) has nearly 30,000 individual members from 85 countries, and 95 corporate members.
