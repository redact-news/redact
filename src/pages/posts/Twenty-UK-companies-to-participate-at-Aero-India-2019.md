Twenty UK companies will attend the Aero India show, India’s biennial air show and aviation exhibition held in Bangalore at the Yelahanka Air Force Station from 20 to 24 February.

“*The UK will attend Aero India in force again this year, reflecting the importance of the UK-India defence relationship. Industry and government representatives will be present to promote some of the world’s most innovative defence and aviation technologies and strengthen relationships with Indian partners,*” read a communiqué from the UK High Commission.

The UK Pavilion, organised by ADS UK Ltd and the UK Department for International Trade’s Defence and Security Organisation (DIT DSO), will host around twenty UK companies.  
   
The UK delegation will include Air Marshal Stuart Evans RAF (Deputy Air Commander, Allied Air Command), Ms Fleur Thomas (Director Export Policy, UK MOD), Air Vice Marshal Nigel Maddox (Senior Military Adviser to DIT DSO) and Sir Dominic Asquith KCMG (British High Commissioner to India).

“*The UK is proud to have a defence partnership with India that benefits both our countries immensely. In the last year, we have worked together in multiple areas: our services have strengthened naval and marine links through Exercises Indradhanush and Konkan; and the visit of the Indian Navy to the Queen Elizabeth — the most advanced aircraft carrier of its class in the world — gave us the opportunity to explore potential joint work on naval capabilities,*” said **Sir Dominic Asquith KCMG**, British High Commissioner to India.  
   
“*We want this strong relationship to continue. Future defence technologies are increasingly going to be delivered by collaborative programmes, in which India has the potential to take its place. Last year at Farnborough Air Show, the UK launched its Future Combat Air Strategy, which committed £1.9Bn of Government funding to develop next-generation combat air technologies, including via international partnerships. This week, we look forward to exploring with India the potential for future collaboration, through which we could jointly build knowledge, security and prosperity,*” he added.
