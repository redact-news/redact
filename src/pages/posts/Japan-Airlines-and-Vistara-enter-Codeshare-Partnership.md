Japan Airlines (JAL) and Vistara have entered a codeshare partnership that will open up more routes between India and Tokyo than ever before. With the signing of this agreement, Vistara becomes the only codeshare partner for Japan Airlines in India. The sales of tickets opened on February 26, 2019 on all channels and major GDS systems, for travel from February 28, 2019.

As part of the agreement, Japan Airlines will add its ‘JL’ designator code to approximately 32 Vistara-operated flights each day across India covering seven Indian cities, namely Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad and Pune. JAL and Vistara already have an interline/through check-in partnership and the two airlines had signed a Memorandum of Understanding in September 2017 to pursue commercial opportunities as partners.

“*The number of passengers traveling between Japan and India has increased over time,*” said **Hideki Oshima**, Executive Officer, Japan Airlines. “*By strengthening the partnership with Vistara, we will be able to provide better network access for our mutual customers. And, we look to further cooperate with Vistara to open up additional opportunities for both airlines.*”

“*We’re delighted to further strengthen our partnership with Japan Airlines with this codeshare agreement, which is a step that underlines our commitment of partnering with some of the leading airlines in the world and of putting Vistara, India’s best airline, on the global map. This partnership helps us offer greater convenience and variety of choice to customers with a comprehensive network, as well as the opportunity of welcoming travellers from Japan and beyond to experience Vistara’s award-winning hospitality and service. We’re confident that our respective customers will truly enjoy the shared benefits of this partnership between two airlines committed to being amongst the best service providers on the ground and in the sky,*” said **Sanjiv Kapoor**, Vistara’s Chief Strategy & Commercial Officer.

The codeshare flights will offer connections to and from a daily flight that JAL already operates to Delhi directly from Tokyo Narita. Japan Airlines and Vistara flights operate from the same terminal at Delhi (T3), making connections at the airport convenient and seamless.

Japan Airlines customers traveling on Vistara will enjoy complimentary meals and will be able to choose between three different cabins, including India’s only Premium Economy class. Japan Airlines Mileage Bank members can also earn miles when booking on ‘JL’ coded Vistara flights.

Vistara today serves 22 destinations with over 800 flights a week and a fleet of 22 aircraft. Recently, Vistara finalized its aircraft order, which is a combination of purchased and leased aircraft totaling 50 from the Airbus A320neo family (including the A321neo) well as six purchased Boeing 787–9 Dreamliner aircraft.

Japan Airlines (JAL) reaches 349 airports in 52 countries and regions together with its codeshare partners with a fleet of 233 aircraft.

TATA SIA Airlines Limited, known by the brand name Vistara, is a joint venture between Tata Sons Limited and Singapore Airlines Limited (SIA) with Tata Sons holding the majority stake of 51% in the company and SIA holding the remaining 49%.
