Airbus will showcase flying displays of its A330neo, the latest addition to the Airbus widebody family, at Aero India, to be held in Bangalore from 20 to 24 February, 2019. Demonstration flights will be performed by the new-generation tactical airlifter C295.

On static display will be Airbus’ most versatile twin-engine rotorcraft — the H135 & H145. The H135 is known for its endurance, compact build, low sound levels, reliability, versatility and cost-competitiveness. The H145 is a member of Airbus’ four-tonne-class twin-engine rotorcraft product range — with designed-in mission capability and flexibility, especially in high and hot operating conditions.

#### Talent acquisition

Airbus will also leverage the event to acquire talent. On February 23 and 24, it will offer members of the public the opportunity to explore career prospects with Airbus India in Avionics Software, Aircraft System Simulation and Airframe Structures as well as in API Development, Full Stack Development, Big Data, Cloud and DevOps.

Airbus will also demonstrate a wide range of service offerings, including through its fully owned subsidiaries Satair and Navblue, with particular focus and demonstrations of Skywise-based digital services. Also on display will be Airbus’ Advanced Inspection Drone which accelerates and facilitates visual checks, considerably reducing aircraft downtime and increasing the quality of inspection reports.

“*It is Airbus’ firm belief that technology and talent are the key to unlocking the enormous potential of the region,*” read a communiqué from the company. In India, it has sought to foster innovation and entrepreneurial spirit through Airbus BizLab, which will be present at Hall E 2.9. Visitors will get a first glance of the opportunities that the startup accelerator has created in the Indian innovation ecosystem. Airbus Bizlab will also partner with Invest India to organise the ‘Startup Day’ at Aero India.

Visitors at the Airbus exhibit — Hall E 2.8 & 2.10 — can witness the company’s commitment to supporting the growth of India’s aviation, defence and space sectors, particularly in the areas of ‘Make in India’ and ‘Startup India.’ Aerospace fans can also savour interactive virtual and augmented reality experiences at the Airbus stand.

“*Aero India is the jewel in the crown of the world’s largest defence and third-largest commercial aviation market,*” said **Anand E Stanley**, President and Managing Director of Airbus India & South Asia. “*Airbus’ large-scale commitment to the show demonstrates that India is more than a market, it’s a core base for us.*”

On display will be scale models of the C295 — medium transport aircraft; the A330 MRTT — Multi-Role Tanker Transport aircraft; the A400M — the most versatile airlifter currently available; the SES-12 — a geostationary communications satellite and a holographic display of the Hybrid SAR Earth observation radar satellite.

In helicopters, scale models of the H225M — the military version of Airbus’ H225 Super helicopter; the AS565 MBe — the all-weather, multi-role force multiplier; along with the H135 and H145 will be on display. Commercial aircraft scale models will include A330–900, the member of Airbus’ A330neo new-generation widebody, the A321neo and ATR 72–600.
