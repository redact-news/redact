ZestMoney was founded in in 2015 by **Lizzie Chapman**, a former Goldman Sachs executive, **Priya Sharma** (CFO & COO), a former associate with Merill Lynch, and **Ashish Anantharaman** (CTO). The three founders had started Wonga.com, before they started ZestMoney.

ZestMoney had raised $2 million in seed funding in September 2015. In February 2017, PayU had led the Series A round of $6.5 million.

ZestMoney and Xiaomi had together launched Mi Finance in 2017 to enable buying of Xiaomi products through card-less EMIs.

The startup, which is operated by *Camdem Town Technologies Pvt Ltd,* is valued at $22 million, according to a sttement by the company.

ZestMoney offers enrollment and real-time approval process, integrated with the ecommerce check-out process, so that users can avail equated monthly instalments (EMIs) to make card-less purchases. The company already works with Amazon, Flipkart, UpGrad and Zefo. ZestMoney sources data from credit information bureaus and other sources to limit its risk exposure.

Very recently, ZestMoney had acquired **PhotographAI**, for improving the customer experience around onboarding and filling forms. The company claims to get close to 3 lakh applications per month and disburse more than Rs 3 crores a day. It aims to reach Rs 3,000 crores a day in disbursals by December 2018.

In October 2017, Xiaomi had invested $8 million in KrazyBee, a student credit platform. Xiaomi plans to invest $1 billion in 100 Indian startups over the next five years. India constitutes Xiaomi’s second largest market after China.
