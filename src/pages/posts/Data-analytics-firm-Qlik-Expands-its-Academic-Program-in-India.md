US-based Data analytics firm Qlik has announced the expansion of its Qlik Academic Program to over 150 universities across India.

“*With free access to our state-of-the-art analytics platform and curated online learning content, students across the country can equip themselves with the necessary data skills they need to thrive in today’s data-led business landscape,*” said **Pankaj Muthe**, Program Manager, Academic Program, APAC, Qlik. “*Through this initiative of getting students exposed to data sooner, we believe that students will be more valuable in the workforce when they graduate and this will significantly accelerate their career growth.*”

The program provides access to the Qlik Data Analytics Curriculum, which offers professors ready-to-teach, free resources — including instructor-led content, in-class activities and interactive business use cases. Students and professors can also take advantage of Qlik Continuous Classroom, a distance-learning platform with over 125 hours of online learning content. With the latest expansion, the Qlik Academic Program is now available at more than 1,200 universities in more than 75 countries.

“*In addition to prominent universities such as IIM Bangalore, IIM Lucknow, IIM Indore, SP Jain School of Global Management, and NIT Karnataka, Qlik has now added renowned names such as IIM Ahmedabad, Loyola Institute of Business Administration, Tata Institute of Social Sciences, University of Petroleum and Energy Studies, NIT Patna, IIM Guwahati, IIM Raipur, and IIM Kozhikode as a part of the program,*” read a communiqué from the company.

According to the company the adoption of the Qlik Academic Program in India is most prominent across institutions offering engineering courses, since analytics aligns well with subjects such as data mining, database management and programming. However, there has been an uptake in other academic streams such as business management and social sciences, which are starting to use the program to both assist with research projects and enable learning for improved decision-making processes through data.

“*We live in the age of technology, and data has naturally emerged as the most important resource for organisations. Despite this, the recent Qlik Data Literacy Survey revealed that almost 80% of the global workforce doesn’t feel it has the required data skills to optimally utilise this high-potential resource,*” said Pankaj Muthe, Program Manager, Academic Program, APAC, Qlik. “*This is the gap that we are looking to address with the Qlik Academic Program.*”
