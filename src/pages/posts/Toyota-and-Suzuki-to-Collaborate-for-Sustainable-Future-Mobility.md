Two years after entering into an MoU for business partnership, Toyota Motor Corporation (Toyota) and Suzuki Motor Corporation (Suzuki) have now announced their agreement to begin considering concrete collaboration in new fields.  
   
The collaboration will bring together Toyota’s strength in electrification technologies and Suzuki’s strength in technologies for compact vehicles. Toyota and Suzuki intend to grow in new fields, such as joint collaboration in production and in the widespread popularization of electrified vehicles.

In India, Toyota will commence local procurement of HEV systems, engines, and batteries. Suzuki will supply two compact vehicles built on Suzuki platforms (Ciaz and Ertiga) to Toyota. Both companies will undertake a joint development of a Toyota C-segment MPV and OEM supply to Suzuki. Suzuki’s compact SUV Vitara Brezza will be produced at Toyota Kirloskar Motor Pvt. Ltd. (TKM) from 2022.

“When it comes to vehicle electrification, which is expected to make further inroads, hybrid technologies are seen as playing a huge role in many markets, as from before. Widespread acceptance is necessary for electrified vehicles to be able to contribute to Earth’s environment. Through our new agreement, we look forward to the wider use of hybrid technologies, not only in India and Europe, but around the world. At the same time, we believe that the expansion of our business partnership with Suzuki — from the mutual supply of vehicles and powertrains to the domains of development and production — will help give us the competitive edge we will need to survive this once-in-a-century period of profound transformation. We intend to strengthen the competitiveness of both our companies by applying our strong points and learning from each other,” said Toyota President Akio Toyoda.  
   
“At the time we announced our scope of cooperation in May last year, I spoke that we will strive for success globally. I have seen progress in the partnership since then, and it is my pleasure to be able to make this announcement today regarding the status of partnership on a global basis, including Europe and Africa. In addition, we appreciate the kind offer from Toyota to let us make use of their hybrid technology. We will continue our utmost efforts,” said Suzuki Chairman Osamu Suzuki.

Toyota and Suzuki have been considering the finer details of the collaboration after having concluded a memorandum of understanding (MoU) for business partnership on February 6, 2017. Provided Toyota and Suzuki continue to fairly and freely compete against each other, both companies intend to consider further collaboration to realize a sustainable future mobility society while respecting all applicable laws.

Details of intended areas of collaboration are outlined in the table below.
