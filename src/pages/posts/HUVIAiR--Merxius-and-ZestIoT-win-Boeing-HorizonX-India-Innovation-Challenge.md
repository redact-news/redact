Three Indian startups — Merxius, HUVIAiR and ZestIoT — joined three teams from Boeing’s India Engineering & Technology Center (BIETC) to showcase disruptive business ideas at the ‘Demo Day’ of the Boeing HorizonX India Innovation Challenge.

Boeing will continue to collaborate with the three external startup teams to help further their businesses. The ideas presented by the Boeing teams are under evaluation as potential future company offerings.

The ideas presented by the three external finalists range from Extended Reality (XR) applications to the use of Internet of Things (IoT) for aerospace. **Merxius** develops a product that enables the creation of XR environments to save cost and reduce training time in aerospace manufacturing. **HUVIAiR** refines custom unmanned aircraft services and software solutions for survey and workflow management. **ZestIoT** explores solutions that connect the airport and airplane ecosystem using IoT to optimize ground handling at airports and improve on-time performance of airplanes.

“*Innovation can happen anywhere and startups around the world have the potential to bring disruptive capabilities to aerospace markets and drive our industry forward,*” said **Brian Schettler**, Managing Director of Boeing HorizonX Ventures. “*Boeing HorizonX is proud to partner with and invest in startups to help them mature and scale their products and services and create value for Boeing customers.*”

“*Both external startups as well as internal ideas promise to disrupt business models and service delivery in aerospace. We are excited to tap into a new pool of ideas from India which will surely change the global aerospace industry,*” said **Pratyush Kumar**, president, Boeing India. “*I am especially proud of our three Boeing teams from India that have made it to the finals with their ideas and technological breakthroughs.*”

The Demo Day marks the culmination of a 3-month accelerator program launched by Boeing \[NYSE: BA\] in collaboration with T-Hub. Following a stringent evaluation process, six teams from a competing pool of more than 100 ideas and applications were selected to join the cohort. The six finalist teams took part in a 3-month accelerator program where thirty subject matter experts from Boeing and T-Hub mentored them and exposed them to potential customers, while strengthening their offerings and capability.

Boeing will continue to collaborate with the three external startup teams to help further their businesses. The ideas presented by the Boeing teams are under evaluation as potential future company offerings.

“*Boeing continues to evaluate disruptive startups in India, apart from the Boeing HorizonX India Innovation Challenge finalists, for potential future investments,*” the company said in a statement.

“*India is known around the world for its inherent capabilities for disruptive innovation. This capability, coupled with a growing aerospace ecosystem offers the opportunity for technological breakthroughs that can redefine the way the world flies,*” said **Amitabh Kant**, CEO, NITI Aayog. “*I am pleased to see the way Boeing is providing a platform to promote innovation in India. Such platforms not only accelerate ‘Startup India’ but also add impetus to ‘Make in India’ and ‘Skill India’.*”
