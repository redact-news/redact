During the meeting with Zhang Jiwen, Commerce Secretary appreciated GACC for expeditiously addressing long pending agricultural market access issues for Indian products, following the understandings reached on these matters at the Informal Summit in Wuhan last year between President, Xi Jinping and Prime Minister, Narendra Modi. Since that Summit, the protocol on exports of non-basmati rice was signed in June 2018 on the sidelines of the SCO Summit. GACC has also approved 6 Indian mills for export of rapeseed meal to China. The protocol on exports of fish meal and fish oil was signed during the visit of China’s Vice Minister of GACC to New Delhi in November 2018.

The GACC has also deputed experts to inspect Indian soyabean meal establishments and pomegranate orchards and pack houses in December 2018. The SPS Protocols for these products are at an advanced stage of negotiation.

During the visit of the Commerce Secretary, India and China also signed the protocol for exports of Indian tobacco leaves to China. Quality tobacco on par with international standards is available in India at competitive prices and there is good potential for export of Indian tobacco to China. “*The revival of the* ***phytosanitory protocol with China*** *will pave the way for revival of Indian tobacco exports to China and prove economically beneficial to Indian farmers,*” read a communiqué issued by the ministry.

The recent period has seen significant progress in market access for a number of agricultural and allied products from India. The Commerce Secretary requested the GACC to expedite market access for other products like okra, soyabean, bovine meat and dairy products.

Commerce Secretary also held a bilateral meeting with **Wang Shouwen**, Vice Minister of China’s Ministry of Commerce, to discuss the progress made under RCEP negotiations and efforts to strengthen bilateral trade.

In November 2018, the Ministry of Commerce & Industry had said that export of **raw sugar from India to China** would begin by early 2019. A contract for exporting 15,000 tonnes of raw sugar has been entered to by the Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA) and COFCO, a Government of China run public sector company.

India plans to export 2 MT of raw sugar to China beginning from 2019. Raw sugar is the second product after non-basmati rice that China will import from India. It is a move to reduce the **USD 60 billion trade deficit** that China has with India. India’s export to China in 2017–18 amounted to USD 33 billion while imports from China stood at USD 76.2 billion.

India is the largest producer of sugar in the world with 32 MMT production in 2018. India produces sugar of all three grades- raw, refined and white.
