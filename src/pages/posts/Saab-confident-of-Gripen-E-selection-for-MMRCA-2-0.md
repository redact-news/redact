Swedish defence major Saab AB (SAAB-B.SK) is confident of its Gripen E being selected for India’s MMRCA 2.0 tender (Medium Multi-Role Combat Aircraft) for 114 fighter aircrafts.

Request for Information (RFI) was issued in April 2018 to the six contenders who participated in the MMRCA tender. “*We replied in a very comprehensive way in July 2018,*” said **Mats Palmberg**, VP Industrial Partnerships & Head of Gripen India Campaign. “*It offers an extensive Transfer of Technology (ToT) package. It is more of a Transfer of Capabilities that can also be used for the Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA).*” The AMCA is an Indian programme of a fifth-generation fighter aircraft which is currently in its early design phase.

Of the 114 aircraft 96 will be produced in India and 18 will be produced in Sweden. Around 25% of the fighters will be tandem seaters. Any manufacturing facility set up for the 96 aircraft in the country could also become an export hub.

“*We bring the opportunity to be a net exporter for the first product. The Gripen E is at par with bigger, heavier aircraft. The system itself facilitates future indigenous upgrades to be undertaken on the platform. India specific enhancements will be quicker, easier and cheaper to achieve by Indian Technicians due to the way in which the systems are designed,*” he said.

“*The strategic partner has to be nominated by the government,*” said **Ola Rignell**, Chairman & Managing Director of Saab in India.

Brazil ordered 36 Gripen NGs from Saab a few years back. The single seater versions will be built in Sweden while the dual-seater version will be designed and built in Brazil. For the development of the 36 Gripen NG fighters for the Brazilian Air Force — 28 one-seat and 8 two-seat -, Saab has a strong collaborative partnership with Brazilian companies such as Embraer, AEL Sistemas, Akaer, Atech, and Atmos.

“*What we offered in 2008 was a demonstrator aircraft. The Gripen E is the finished product that has been on-schedule and on-cost,*” said the spokesperson for Saab AG.

“*Last time we had three aircrafts here. This time it was pretty late to bring the aircraft due to a delay in the announcement of the venue. It’s a shame we can’t come and fly, but I am sure we’ll be back and flying again,*” said the spokesperson for Saab AG.

The company is vying for a plethora of opportunities in India in the air domain apart from the MMRCA 2.0 : naval fighter procurement for 57 aircraft, Self Protection Systems like IDAS 2/3 for different helicopters (ALH,LCH,LUH), Radar and EW suits and Avionics update of Air Force, Army and Navy helicopters.

In the naval domain the company is looking to participate in the the P75(I) submarine project, autonomous underwater vehicles, Superstructures, Mine counter measure vehicles, surface vessels and maritime traffic management.
