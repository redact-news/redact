Xerox(NYSE: XRX) is expanding its operations in Bangalore. The company has augmented its HR team in Bangalore, in order to support this expansion.

“*Xerox is rebuilding itself into a technology powerhouse. We are expanding our operations in Bangalore,*” said **Steve Bandrowczak**, who was recently appointed as president and chief operations officer, and a member of the company’s Executive Committee (from June 25, 2018).

Earlier this month, the company hosted an invitation only hiring event for HR professionals. “*We are looking for 32 HR associates and 2 HR team leaders to support managers and employees globally,*” said Bandrowczak.

Bandrowczak is responsible for developing and executing a global operations strategy in the company’s business support functions, including product and service delivery, customer billing, information technology, global procurement and real estate.

Xerox appointed John Visentin as its new CEO in May, after Jeff Jacobson’s exit. In June, the company appointed Mary McHugh as chief delivery officer and Steve Bandrowczak as EVP, president and COO. The new leadership is working on making it easier to do business with Xerox. The new team has a strong channels and services background, which is in line with the company’s strategy to increase channel and SMB focus.

“*His (Bandrowczak’s) breadth of experience across the product and service delivery chain will be essential to generating value for our shareholders and building more effective and efficient ways to serve our customers,*” said **John Visentin**, Xerox vice chairman and chief executive officer, on appointing Bandrowczak as EVP, president and COO.

In India, Xerox is increasing the number of channels partners and system integrators. The company has reportedly increased its market share in India from 20 percent to 25 percent over the previous two quarters.

Meanwhile, Xerox is cutting jobs at locations across the US and Canada, as part of Xerox’s initiative to optimize its operations globally.

Similarly, business process outsourcing firm **Conduent** (erstwhile *Xerox Business Services division*), which was spun off from Xerox two years ago, has been steadily increasing its footprint in India. Conduent now employs 12,000 people in India. Over three thousand people were added over the last year, since Lokesh Prasad took over as CEO at Conduent. In line with its cost-cutting strategy, the company has been moving work to lower-cost locations and has reduced its global headcount from 90,000 in December 2017 to nearly 84,000 by the end of June 2018. India and the APAC region are strategic markets and growth regions for Conduent.
