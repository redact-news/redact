The state of Karnataka, in South India is actively promoting sustainable organic agriculture by increasing awareness and market access for traditional super-foods that have been endemic to the region. Being an early mover, in terms of government policy, places the state in a leadership role in transforming agriculture in the subcontinent.

“*The Government of Karnataka is the first State to have Organic Policy in 2004. Since 2004, the area under organic cultivation registered a steady growth from 2500 hectares to 100,000 hectares under fully certified organic cultivation as on date,”* said **Manoj Kumar Menon**, Exec Director ICCOA (International Competence Centre for Organic Agriculture).

The Economic Survey 2018 (released in January this year), for the first time mapped how climate change in the Indian subcontinent was resulting in an adverse impact on agricultural yields. According to the survey, climate change could reduce annual agricultural incomes in the range of 15% — 18% on average and up to 20% — 25% for unirrigated areas. Agriculture accounts for 16 per cent of gross domestic product and 49 per cent of employment in India, making it crucial in the overall economy.

Farmers in arid parts of Karnataka are already switching from water-intensive crops like rice, sugarcane and maize cultivation to millets, which require upto 70 per cent less water.

“*As per APEDA (Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority), the State wise export data in 2017–2018 total value of organic product exported from Karnataka is about 186 crores. As per ICCOA’s estimate total value of Organic Production from Karnataka would be approximately 8000 Crores,*” added Manoj Kumar Menon.

“*A revised policy on organic farming was brought out during 2017, incorporating new objectives and strategies giving major thrust to marketing. Organic farmers associations formed under the promotional programmes in the State have been categorized into 15 regional organic federations through which organics and millets processing and marketing activities are being taken up. The ultimate objective of the policy is to develop an organised market and to popularise organics and millets as ‘Super Foods’*,” said **Maheshwar Rao**, Principal Secretary, Department of Agriculture, Government of Karnataka.

“*Favourable climate and a diverse production base offer immense opportunities for the State. Our farmers have combined indigenous and innovative methods to pioneer the organics and millet agriculture movement. Organic agriculture sector in the State is gaining momentum with markets experiencing double digit growth year-on-year, while millets have emerged on the scene as the new nutri-cereal*,” said **N. H. Shivashankara Reddy**, Minister for Agriculture, Government of Karnataka.

#### Organics and Millets International Trade Fair 2019

The Government of Karnataka is organising the second edition of the Organics and Millets International Trade Fair 2019 from 18th to 20th January 2019 at the Palace Grounds in Bangalore. The event is expected to address aspects of the value chain, from farm to shelf, and position the State of Karnataka as a source for ‘Next Gen’ smart foods and businesses.

The event, which is mainly for farmers, buyers, sellers and exporters of organic produces and millets, will have the participation of over 250 exhibitors occupying an exhibition space of 10,000 square meters including stalls from other states, countries, Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs) and several farmer federations from Karnataka. International Competence Centre for Organic Agriculture (ICCOA) will be the knowledge partner for the event.

“*The previous edition of the event saw footfalls of around 1 lakh visitors including farmers, students, scientists, businessmen and general public. More than 225 B2B and F2B meetings were conducted during the event. Business and potential orders generated at the event was to the tune of Rs. 107 crore with MoUs worth 13218 metric tonnes of organic and millet products being signed. Long term commitments for the next three years are estimated at Rs. 340 crores. From the international perspective, we had six delegations participating from USA, Japan, South Korea, China, Germany and The Netherlands. Business of around Rs.4.5 crores was generated across various counters during the three days fair,*” said **Maheshwar Rao**.

“*There is big potential for farmer’s revenue to expand if they are connected through proper market structure. This trade fair is organized to serve the same objective and make Karnataka an Organic and Millets Hub,*” said **Manoj Kumar Menon**.

“*The second edition of the Organics and Millets International Trade Fair 2019 will be the largest congregation of India’s Organic and Millets community. Through this event, we want to emphasise our positioning of Karnataka as the Organics and Millets Capital of India. We will be conducting roadshows in places like Coimbatore, Pune and New Delhi to create awareness about the event and encourage participation. We will also be conducting key district level melas across the State to attract visitors and participation,*” said **H.N. Shivashankar Reddy**. “*We will also be conducting roadshows abroad to rope in foreign delegations, buyers, food processers, bloggers and journalists. The Trade fair has brought in a new era in the field of organic foods and millets across a wide spectrum of stakeholders. We hope that more people turn to organics and millets as part of their daily food intake and take advantage of its health benefits.*”
