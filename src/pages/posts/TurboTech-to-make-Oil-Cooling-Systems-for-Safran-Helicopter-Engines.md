TurboTech Defence and Aerospace is set to produce Oil Cooling Systems and components for the Safran Ardiden 1U Helicopter Engine at its new plant in Bangalore, India. Production is scheduled to start from June 2019.

The Oil Cooling System (OCS), designed and developed for Ardiden 1H engine, by TurboTech is intended for use in the European and Indian market.

After successfully designing the OCS the units have undergone 28 Qualification tests successfully as specified by the Center for Military Airworthiness (CEMILAC), the Certifying agency. TurboTech has produced 500+ OCS units so far and accumulated more than 70,000 hrs of snag free operational flying operating on Advanced Light Helicopter ALH (Mark-III &IV).

“*The collaboration was envisaged when Safran expressed interest in procuring these units for their joint development of Ardiden 1U engine with HAL during one of the visits. Further, it was revealed that to supply these units for international market it was necessary to upgrade our facilities and qualify Safran quality requirement. Accordingly, we have upgraded all our facilities to the satisfaction of Safran to emerge as approved supplier. Our company is also an AS 9100 Rev D certified facility,*” said **Krishnakumar**, Managing Director TurboTech.

TurboTech has also designed and developed the Uplock system for the indigenously built Tejas(LCA) aircraft. The Uplock units are one of the important LRUs of undercarriage operations. It is a Hydro Mechanical precision aggregate. As the Uplock is one of the flight critical units of LCA, the quality and reliability of aerospace standards are to be ensured during production and manufacturing. LCA uses three types of Uplocks namely Main Under Carriage, Nose Under Carriage, Main Under Carriage Door and Nose Under carriage Door Uplocks. However, Nose Under Carriage and Main Under Carriage Door Uplocks are common. Based on the functionality they are categorised as Type1, Type 2 and Type 3 respectively.

TurboTech also manufacturers Turbo Chargers for the V92S2 Engine fitted on T90 tanks. Engine Factory Avadi, Chennai, has placed an order for the production of turbochargers for Army Tank T-90. Turbochargers are centrifugal compressors driven by an exhaust gas turbine and employed in engines to boost the charge air pressure. Turbocharger performance enhances engine performance in terms of fuel economy, power, and emissions.

TurboTech has a total of 8 patents pending in India and 6 patents pending in the US. TurboTech Defence and Aerospace is a wing of the 25-year-old TurboTech Precision Engineering Pvt Ltd.
