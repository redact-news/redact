Boeing \[NYSE: BA\] handed over the first four CH-47F(I) Chinooks to the Indian Air Force at an induction ceremony at the Air Force Station, Chandigarh. The CH-47F(I) Chinooks had arrived at the Mundra Port in Gujarat in February this year, ahead-of-schedule.

These helicopters will be deployed in the Northern and Eastern regions of India.

The CH-47F(I) Chinook for the Indian Air Force completed successful first-flights in July 2018. The first batch of Indian Air Force crew began their training to fly the Chinook in the U.S. in October 2018.

The Indian Ministry of Defence had finalized its order with Boeing for production, training and support of 15 CH-47F(I) Chinook helicopters in September 2015. The last batch is to be delivered by March next year.

The CH-47F is an advanced multi-mission helicopter for the U.S. Army and international defense forces. The CH 47 F(I) helicopter has been customized to suit IAF’s future requirements and capability roadmap.

It contains a fully integrated, digital cockpit management system, Common Aviation Architecture and advanced cargo-handling capabilities that enhance the aircraft’s mission performance and handling characteristics. It is used by the U.S. Army, U.S. Army Reserve, National Guard and by the armed forces of more than 19 countries, including Canada, the United Kingdom, Netherlands, Japan, Italy, Greece, Spain, South Korea, Australia and the United Arab Emirates.

The ceremony was attended by the Air Chief Marshal B.S. Dhanoa, Chief of Air Staff, senior officers from the Indian Air Force and officials from Boeing.

“*The induction of the CH-47F(I) Chinooks is an asset to the Indian Air Force’s airlift capabilities,*” said **Air Chief Marshal B.S. Dhanoa**, Chief of Air Staff. “*This modern, multi-mission-capable, heavy-lift transport helicopter will enhance our heli-lift capability across all types of terrain to full effect.*”

“*The CH-47F(I) Chinook will prove to be a significant force multiplier for the Indian Air Force,*” said **Salil Gupte**, president, Boeing India. “*We are committed to working closely with the defense forces and government of India to deliver the right value and capabilities.*”

“*With its advanced capabilities and versatility, we are confident that the CH-47F(I) Chinook will be an important asset to the Indian Air Force,*” said **Michael Koch**, vice president, India, Boeing Defense, Space & Security. “*Boeing remains committed to working closely with India to support the modernization of its armed forces and fulfil the country’s current and future security goals.*”
