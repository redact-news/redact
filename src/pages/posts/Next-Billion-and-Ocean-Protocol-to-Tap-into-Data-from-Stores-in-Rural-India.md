Next Billion and Ocean Protocol are collaborating to pilot a new data sharing model that gives store owners in rural India an extra stream of income. Next Billion creates insights to enable companies to expand in high-growth emerging markets. The company provides free point-of-sale (POS) platforms to rural store owners to record real-time inventory and sales data. It is building a data marketplace and piloting a new data sharing model on Ocean Protocol.

Through the pilot, stores in rural India will capture real-time transactions through the POS platform and are incentivised to consistently use this platform to submit verified data. When companies buy their syndicated data, transactions can be traced back to the source via Ocean Protocol, enabling Next Billion to reward these rural store owners with royalties.

Next Billion was founded in 2013 and operates insight programs with commercial partners in 10+ countries across APAC & Africa. Its consumer and retail platforms build new opportunities for data creators (mom & pop shops, part-time workers, etc) to collect & share value from their data.

“*We believe global companies’ needs for commercial data can unlock sustainable and inclusive business models that empower local data providers to share fair value from their data,*” said **Oliver Gilbert**, Managing Director of Next Billion. “*Ocean Protocol enables Next Billion to monetize data and share it with companies in a safe and secure manner.*”

“*A lot of data is generated today, yet they are locked up in silos because people are scared of losing control and not getting rewarded. Ocean helps to solve this by giving the tools for people to own and control their data and develop new data-driven business models,*” said **Bruce Pon**, founder of Ocean Protocol. “*Data owners can program the conditions of access which are then executed precisely. In addition, data can be traced back to its source, enabling incentives to be spread across all stakeholders in the data sharing process.*”

Ocean Protocol is a blockchain-based platform for sharing of data. It enables companies and data services to build on top. Ocean also allows algorithms and models to come to the data, get trained and then leave without exposing the data or taking a copy.

FMCG companies are eying this new opportunity and have revved up their distribution channels in rural areas. This has been reflected by a significant rise in demand for rural market research data. However, traditional market research firms lack rural reach, maintain outdated platforms premised on different environments, and their costs remain prohibitively expensive.

“*Being incentivised along with transparency on how data is being used increases the willingness for people to share data,*” Gilbert added. “*We hope to provide high quality and agile retail insights at a fraction of what the traditional market research firms would charge while targeting an increase in sustainable livelihoods by 30–50%.*”

Despite the lack of digitization in retail practice in rural Asia, sales are climbing. Driven by the rise of the middle class, the consumption of fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) in rural areas is growing across Asia. From 2009 to 2012, spending by India’s 800+ million rural residents reached $69 billion, some 25% more than their urban counterparts over the same period. According to recent estimates, consumption in rural areas is growing at 1.5 times the rate in urban areas. The current $12 billion consumer goods market in rural India is expected to reach $100 billion by 2025.
