Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as part of his Independence Day speech, proclaimed that India would undertake its human spaceflight programme by 2022.

“*When India completes 75 years of Independence in 2022, or maybe even before that, an Indian son or daughter will go to space aboard ‘Gaganyaan’,*” Modi said in his speech.

ISRO’s Human Spaceflight Programme (HSP), which has been in progress since 2004, has been developing capabilities to send *vyomanauts* (Indian astronauts) to space. ISRO has already spent over Rs 2 billion on the programme. ISRO is expected to prepare a detailed project report over the next two months.

Several critical components are being tested for the human spaceflight programme and a prototype for the first space suit has also been developed according to ISRO chairman K. Sivan[\*](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/critical-technologies-for-human-space-mission-on-track-says-isro-1899331). Just last month (July 5), ISRO tested a Crew Escape System (CES), which would enable a crew inside a capsule to abort their mission and eject during an emergency. The additional funds required for the programme is estimated to be under Rs 100 billion.

ISRO’s Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mark III (**GSLV MK-III**) is the launch vehicle chosen for the human spaceflight programme. ISRO successfully conducted the first orbital test launch of GSLV-III on 5 June 2017 from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Andhra Pradesh. In June 2018, the Union Cabinet approved Rs 43.38 billion (US$630 million) to build 10 GSLV Mk-III rockets over a five-year period.

The announcement of the date by the Prime Minister has imposed a tight schedule on ISRO, which is still in the early stages of development and testing of various systems and sub-systems like Crew Module (CM), Crew Escape System (CES) and Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS). However, ISRO chairman K. Sivan expressed confidence in being able to develop the systems on time.

Wing Commander **Rakesh Sharma** (Retd), who went on a Russian mission in 1984, has been the only Indian citizen in space so far.

On 7th July 2018, Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Chairman **Kailasavadivoo Sivan** spoke about the human spaceflight programme at the **L M Katre memorial lecture**. “*In the human space program the contribution from the air force will be very strong,*” he said during the lecture. Below are some excerpts from his lecture.

*“Taking a human into space is not very simple. Writing is very simple, Talking is very simple. But making it happen is a very difficult job; a very costly job. So globally people are trying to make a collaborative effort to ensure that future human space programs are viable. Not only the government space agencies, a lot of private players have come into the picture. Because of the potential use of human explorations in terms of science, in terms of resources, and bringing the best part from space to earth there are lot of private parties also coming into the picture. They are global efforts and definitely India also cannot keep quiet. We also have to join the team. This cannot be done by only one organisation; it has to be a combined effort. We can always send a rocket ourselves, but when we are sending a fellow in a spacecraft, we are definitely not sufficient. We need to take support. Indian Air Force is going to play a major role in these things - certifying the person, certifying the system to function and many other things. The future endeavour is going to be a combined endeavour of ISRO and IAF and aeronautical agencies like HAL and ADA. It has to be a national effort, only then we can achieve that.”*

### Other Future Programmes

Speaking about the insatiable tendency of humans to yearn for ‘better, cheaper and faster’ he spoke of future launch concepts. “*Now we are happy to travel to moon in four days. Right now our travel to Mars will take about a year — one way trip. People wanted to make it fast. How to make it fast? To Moon, to Mars they want to go just like coming from Chennai to Bangalore. Now there is a trend called Lightcraft. This propulsion will not have a propellent like liquid, cryo or semi-cryo. All the liquid propulsion systems will be lost. We have a separate propulsion system called Lightcraft Propulsion System- a laser propulsion system. A study indicates that if you are going in a light craft with a laser propulsion system you can go to Mars in three days.*”

#### Expendable Launch Vehicles to Reusable Launch Vehicles

Over a year ago ISRO had conducted experiments on Air Breathing Propulsion and Reusable Launch Vehicles. With respect to Reusable Launch Vehicles, ISRO chairman K. Sivan explained the marriage of aircraft and rocket technology.

“*Nearly 50 percent of the aircraft is the structure, about 20–25 percent of the aircraft is the fuel, the remaining 25 percent is the payload. While around 87 percent of the rocket is propellent or explosive. Instead of 50 percent in the aircraft we have only 13–14 percent of the weight for the structure. There is no space for payload. The rocket borrows some payload from the structure and converts the structure into payload.*”

“*The time has come to marry aircraft and rocket. A machine having a combination of the complexities of an aircraft and of a rocket. That is the future of the aerospace industry.*”

*Nearly 80 percent of the rocket construction cost is spent on the structure. That is 15 percent of the structural mass will consume 85 percent of the cost of the vehicle and nearly 85 percent of the propellent will cost only 15 percent of the rocket cost. What we are doing is after consuming the propellent we are simply throwing the 85 percent cost of the vehicle. That is called expendable vehicle.*  *Why not make use of this particular structure. Bring it back to Earth and reuse. That is called reusable launch vehicle technology. Many methods and strategies can be followed.*

#### ISRO’s Reusable Launch Vehicles to be more economical than SpaceX variants

The ISRO chief felt that the method used by SpaceX, which has succeeded in recovering the first stage of its launch vehicle, is rather inefficient as a lot of fuel is needed to bring back its first stage.

“*Even though it is a fantastic idea — the SpaceX mode of bringing the structure back is not at all cost effective. Even though they say that a payload will be flying with a reusable launch vehicle, that particular mission has a payload capacity nearly half of the capacity of the vehicle. We don’t want to do that. We want to make use of the full capability of the vehicle.*”

*The second stage also is equally costly. We don’t want half or partial reuse. As Indians we are really cost conscious. We are kanjoos in spending money. Indians always try to make maximum utilisation, maximum use. That is our speciality. We want to reuse not only one stage we want to reuse everything. We want to make use of the second stage also.*

*How to recover the second stage? The SpaceX mode of bringing the stage back cannot work because when it is coming from the orbit the stage coming with a velocity equal to mach 25, that is something like 7.5 km/sec. All this energy will be converted into thermal energy. In fact even carbon carbon will burn at this temperature. It can be achieved by having a winged re-entry vehicle. That’s what Indians have demonstrated last year — a winged re-entry vehicle. That is the easiest way of recovering from the orbit. Last year what we demonstrated was a stage — it is looks like an aircraft, but it is going to space and coming back. We are taking the help of aeronautical agencies for developing this.*

*We have demonstrated one portion of the technology. Now we are in the process of demonstrating the other technology, namely automatic landing as well as coming from the orbit. Again whatever the pilot was doing we have to do through auto-pilot. The intelligence of the pilot has to be converted to the machine and robotics. This is another system we are working and i am sure that for this purpose also there must be a good interaction between different agencies to ensure that the systems are developed and established nicely.*

#### Air Breathing Propulsion

*Rockets have to fly from Mach 0 to Mach 25, using the air-breathing engine for high mach number. The aircraft engine is not sufficient. If you have rotating parts and complex systems it cannot function at high mach number.*

*So what we are bringing is a ram-jet and a scram-jet. Scram jet is the simplest structure in the world — it is nothing but a box, a square box. and you are trying to make propulsion out of a square box; whatever compression the aircraft engine is producing by shaping the inlet of the scram jet engine.*

*The shape will produce shocks. The shock wave will compress the air and send the compressed air to the combustion chamber. When the compressed air has gone inside we need to have propulsion, inject a fuel and ignite. But this speed of the air inside ranges from mach number 2–4 inside the compression chamber. Now igniting the air and fuel mixture at mach 5, is just like keeping a small flame on a matchstick in a hurricane. How to keep this flame attached to the igniter is another complex technology. When the shock is producing compressed air and when the shock is not properly designed instead of giving thrust, it will give drag. One scram jet engine was successfully demonstrated by ISRO last year.*

*If you see the rocket engine, nearly 80 percent of the rocket mass is oxidised air. We are unnecessarily carrying the oxidised air along with us to orbit. And out of this 80 percent nearly 54 percent of the mass of the oxidised air is getting burnt during atmospheric phase. If you are taking a rocket with 400 tonne mass, nearly 200 tonne is the oxidised air that we are carrying from Sriharikota, which will be consumed within an altitude of 20–25 kilometres. Why unnecessarily carry and burn? Why not make use of the atmosphere? That is the reason the air breathing propulsion system comes into the picture. But our atmosphere is not there everywhere, after 20 kilometres useful atmosphere is not there.*

*People are thinking about combining the rocket and air breathing engines , called* ***Rocket based Combined Cycle Engine****. The engine is a marriage between rocket and aircraft engine. The engine will function as a jet engine initially then slowly it will function as a ramjet, then after that it will function as a scramjet, the same engine once it has gone out of atmospheric conditions will function as a rocket engine. This beautiful concept is emerging and this is going to shape the future of aerospace technologies.*

*Another interesting aspect is also coming into the picture — we need not carry the oxygen. Beyond 20 km there is no atmosphere. During the flight of the vehicle, during the atmospheric phase, the system can be designed which will convert the air, and will liquify the air and will get oxygen and store it.While the vehicle is flying this will extract the oxygen and store in the tank. That oxygen will be used in future flying. This is a very interesting rocket. Maybe 20 years back it was in the imagination stage; now we are in the picture to produce this type of rocket air breathing system. I am sure aeronautical engineers and spacecraft engineers have to work intensely to produce this type of craft which is going to make changes in the world scenario.*

#### Focus on New Materials

Rocket structures require materials that can withstand high thermal stress. “*There are walls in the rocket structure that are 0.8 mm thick, where one side would experience temperatures of around 4000 Kelvin while the other side would be maintained at around 20 Kelvin.*”

*The materials we are using right now is a somewhat heavy material. If researchers come out with a high strength to weight ratio material — We are talking about material developments like carbon nanotubes — These technologies coming from the lab to the industry would definitely make it possible to have a Single Stage to Orbit vehicle. In fact at the national level this carbon nanotube development was initiated some time back.*

#### Space Resources

*Why not take resources from the space? In space huge resources are available. We have a moon. Moon is a place where plenty of Helium-3 is available. That Helium-3 can be used in nuclear power plants in the fusion process. The present fission system will produce a lot of nuclear waste. Even though we are happy that we got good clean power from nuclear power plant the people from Koodankulam are asking us to close because they feel that the nuclear waste coming from the nuclear power plant will be harmful for them. But using Helium 3 this issue will not be there. There will be technology required to convert that power. Very high pressure, high temperature will be there. That is a strategy to be developed.*

*Some of the asteroids coming from space are rich in minerals, rich in materials. Some people even doubt that there are diamonds available in asteroids. Definitely, something available in space should not be allowed to go waste. So we want to go and mine the asteroid.*

#### Triveni — A *convergence of many disciplines*

*When advanced technologies are coming it cannot be done by a single team or a single discipline or single department. It would be possible to realise the vehicles and make a product only by a triveni — the convergence of many disciplines and departments together. You just wait for next 20 or 30 years you will find a different world . We should not be satisfied with whatever system we have right now — conventional rockets and conventional aircrafts.*
