Singapore Airlines is set to operate a luxurious Airbus A350–900 between Bangalore and Singapore with ten flights each week from May 17. 2019. It will be the first airline to start A350 services from the Bangalore Airport.

The Kempegowda International Airport (or Bangalore Airport) will begin its Summer Schedule 2019 from March 31, featuring four new domestic routes, a new airline and additional two cargo flights to international destinations. The Schedule will be in force until October 26, 2019.

Agra, Nashik (Indigo), Gwalior (Spice Jet) and Jamnagar (Star Air) are the new routes, giving passengers the opportunity for non-stop flights. Flynas will be the new airline as the Saudi Arabia-based budget carrier has proposed to operate three weekly flights between BLR Airport and Jeddah.

Cargo movement from Bangalore will get a boost as Spice Jet has proposed to operate additional flights to Singapore and Abu Dhabi from May 1.
