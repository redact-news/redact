Ather Energy chose the **World Environment Day** to launch the Ather **450** electric scooter along with their previously unveiled variant the Ather **340**. Limited pre-orders have opened on Ather’s website and, their experience centre, AtherSpace at Indiranagar will open for test rides on Friday, 8th June.

Ather’s S340 was originally unveiled in February 2016 with a series of specifications which have been significantly upgraded since then. While the hardware on both models is essentially identical, the 340 is a **software-limited** version of the 450.

“*The key differentiator of the Ather 450 are its intelligence features, seamless charging and ownership experience,*” the company said in a statement.

The Ather 450 comes with a top speed of 80 km/hr, a range of 75 km and one of the quickest accelerations of 3.9 seconds from 0–40 km/hr in the scooter market. The software-limits cannot be altered following homologation.

The 450 comes with a home charging Point, that will be installed by the company at either owners’ homes or workplace.

The Ather 450 has been designed to solve for problems limiting current electric two-wheelers, like slow charging speeds, low powered motors, and short battery lives. It can **fast charge to 80%** at a rate of **1 km/minute**. It comes with a **3.3kW BLDC motor** that can comfortably ride up 18-degree slopes, making steep parking lots, flyovers, and roads an easy climb. And for the first time in the category, Ather 450 comes with **parking assist**, which allows riders to reverse into tight parking locations.

*“In the last 4 years we have not only built the scooter, but an ecosystem for an electric vehicle future. Be it the suppliers and partners who were entering the EV market, the charging infrastructure that had to be set up for consumers and the engineering talent itself to build the products. Between the Ather 450 & Ather 340 launching and AtherGrid being up and running in Bengaluru, we are really looking forward to expanding into Chennai & Pune in the coming months,”* said **Mehta,** co-founder & CEO, Ather Energy.

The vehicle production line is in Whitefield in Bangalore and has been running trial production for almost two months. The company is starting its commercial production from July. Deliveries of the pre-orders will start from August onwards in Bangalore. The pre-order deliveries will continue throughout the year.

“*Our team has put almost 1.5 million man-hours. This has taken us almost 55 prototypes over these years to get to the 340 that’s in trial production today*,” he said.

Ather Energy has filed **43 patent** applications along with 11 international patent applications and **122 design registrations** with their product that’s designed in India.

“*When you build a product you’re not building it around cool engineering that you want to do, you’re building it around use cases*,” said **Tarun Mehta*,*** co-founder & CEO, Ather Energy.

#### Navigation

*Needing navigation on your two wheeler is possibly one of the most important use cases that exists today that we just can’t solve. This is one of the things we wanted to build right from day one. The solution was to build something from scratch; starting from the entire hardware and software layer for the vehicle, integrated into the handlebar design.*

*Open up your Ather app, just cue in that location, once you’ve got the location there, just hit “Send to Scooter.” Then when you get on to the vehicle and turn it on navigation is already on there.*

*The navigation looks exactly how you expect it to look. It does not look like it was designed in Germany by some company and then has been imported to India for some weird application.*

Ather 450 has a 7” touchscreen dashboard that allows onboard navigation with options of alternative routes and saved locations. It comes with the Ather app that enables push navigation from the phone to the vehicle dashboard, remote monitoring of the vehicle health, charge monitoring and managing service requirements.

#### Park Assist

*You just need to be able to reverse the vehicle back without putting in all your energy. You just swipe a screen, you’re now in reverse mode. Scooter pulls back and you’ve got enough torque to get out of any situation. The speed is limited to 5 kmph.*

#### Charging Infrastructure

*There is literally no place where you can charge an electric vehicle in India today. There is no infrastructure. Our cities were not built with any electric vehicle infrastructure in mind. What we always heard was this was a chicken and egg problem because the infrastructure companies would have to first see enough vehicle demand to build the infrastructure up and the vehicle companies wanted to see the infrastructure before they started selling anything. So we at Ather started building* ***Ather Grid****, which is our public and home charging solution two years back. The idea is to set up enough public charging stations across the city so that you are never more than four kilometers away from the nearest public charging point.*

#### OTA Updates

*Right from day one the entire vehicle was built with over-the-air update facility. All of the hardware has been completely upgradable right from day one. Every part, whether it’s a battery management system, charger, motor, dashboard, Ather will keep pushing upgrades onto your vehicle every few months.*

The company is expected to soon roll out features like **theft-detection** and **accident detection**.

#### Servicing

*Typically your vehicle will know what’s up before even you know — which means the vehicle has very strong* ***remote diagnostic capability*** *built in. If there is a bearing issue, anything up with the electronics, the vehicle will flag it out even before you pick that up.*

*Servicing is doorstep pick up and delevery. We dont expect you to find the nearest Ather representative, we will come to you. You can even track the person coming to your doorstep to actually do the service.*

*All this is through the mobile phone app. Once you are done with the servicing you can go and look up all the service that has happened in the past.*

#### Ather One — Subscription model

*When do I get my brake pads changed, when do I get my belts changed, when do i get my oil changed. You can’t remember the frequency.*

*We’ve taken all of that together and packaged them into a single subscription plan.*

*For a single flat fee that is paid every month under which Ather will take care of scheduled maintenance, labour charges, any consumables, data services for the dashboard, roadside assistance, breakdown assistance. If you’re out of charge on the road we will send somebody to give you a quick charge.*

*Under this plan you will have unlimited access to Ather’s public charging infrastructure — Ather Grid.*

*This is possibly one of the* ***biggest non-technical innovations*** *that we’ve pulled off with our products.*

For the first set of consumers, Ather Energy is offering the first year of the subscription plan for free. The company will also provide a home charging Point with the Ather 450 and a charging cable with the Ather 340. The price of these products and their installation will be waived off for these consumers.

The total cost includes what consumers pay upfront to buy the scooter and a monthly subscription that will take care of most operational expenses.

#### Financing

*A typical petrol scooter, if you go and look for financing will come at 12–14 percent. The 340 and 450 come with an 8.5% interest rate. You can go as high as five years on the EMI. Paired with financing, these scooters will be one of the most efficient purchases that you can have.*

*“We started building electric scooters four years ago at IIT Madras and we are super excited to launch not only the Ather 340, but also our higher performance flagship variant, the Ather 450. It has been designed with quick acceleration, great handling, high storage space and new-to-category features like park assist, remote diagnostics, and onboard navigation,”* said Tarun Mehta*.*

Ather was co-founded in 2013 by IIT graduates — [tarun mehta](https://medium.com/u/8f37f93473f9) and [Swapnil Jain](https://medium.com/u/51f8e38d9be). The company is backed by the founders of Flipkart, Tiger Global and Hero Motocorp.

*Initially we looked at the battery and sort of zeroed it down to being the problem point. You build a better battery pack, you’ve got a better charging rate, a lower charging time, better overall life, you can do better acceleration. So we started by building the battery-pack first at Ather four years back.*

*Very few strong vendors exist for the electric vehicle ecosystem — When you think electric there are not a lot of components that exist today. The supply chain, the vendor ecosystem, is just not evolved enough when you think of the charger, dashboard, battery management system, motor.*

*We could engineer a lot of these pieces from scratch. Not just a battery, but the charger, the battery management system, a dashboard that will work for our conditions, the entire software layer, the UI. Not just the subsystems but even the chasis is completely built from scratch.*

*Internal combustion engines are a beautiful piece of art that has evolved over 100 years for this particular form factor. When you move to electric vehicles you need to rethink the entire architecture.*

*Commercialising at scale producing something consistently in large numbers has been a place where a lot of hardware startups have struggled in the past.*

*So that’s the journey that we’ve been on for the last two years. Setting up a production for the 340. Setting up the manufacturing line, setting up the battery assembly line, working and onboarding of partner ecosystem that stretches to almost a 100 suppliers in India and globally, getting the right quality, getting the right cost structures and producing something consistently.*

*What we don’t have a lot of are an* ***ecosystem of people who can do new product development from scratch*** *— take a concept at this stage, literally with a white paper and have the patience and the energy to go 2,3,4,5 years and see it converting into reality. We have a* ***250 people team*** *here which stretches across electrical, power electronics, embedded hardware, mechanical components, automotive plastics, casting, sheet metal and across industries like health care.* ***Putting them all together to work on a single product has probably been one of our hardest journeys.***

*There is no infrastructure for electric vehicles in India where we recharge on the road. So this has been a challenge that we’ve been on in the last two years. We’ve been building our own charging network — a public and home charging infrastructure which can ensure that you’re never too far away from the nearest charging point ever in the city conditions. We launched it two weeks back and it’s already live across 17 points in Bangalore.*

*So what started originally four years back as just a little bit of work around the battery pack and just a small technology challenge, has over the last four years become the pursuit of* ***creation of a complete industry*** *— not just the engineering, not just the product, not just the body works, not just the people, not just the manufacturing, not just the company culture but a complete industry. The 340 for us is just a* ***launch platform****. We’re really trying to build an engine of an organization that can churn out product after product after product in the EV space.*
