The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) will be implementing an end-to-end prediction system for predicting thunderstorms and lightning by April 2019.

The IMD is strengthening the observational network and by end of this year, 10 new X-band weather radars will be installed over NW Himalayas (J &K, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand).

The Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) and IMD are developing prediction tools for thunderstorm/lightning. IITM Pune has already installed 48 lightning sensors around the country which can locate the thunderstorm/lightning activities in real time.

IITM Pune also developed a Mobile App called “Damini” to give alerts on impending lightning activity over the area. The Damini App is available on the Google Playstore.

Eleven more C-band radars will be installed by IMD by 2020 over the plains of India including one over Andaman Nicobar Islands and one over Lakshadweep Islands.

“*In addition, IMD is installing 200 Automated Weather Stations at District Agromet Units for providing weather services to farmers and another 200 AWS will be installed over major cities and towns for providing City Specific Weather information and forecasts,*” said Union Minister of Science and Technology, Earth Sciences and Environment and Forests and Climate Change, **Dr. Harsh Vardhan**.

All these observatories are expected to be established by end of 2020. On the specific request from Kerala Government, IMD will be installing 100 new Automated Weather Stations including rain-gauges to monitor weather activities in the state.

IITM Pune with the help of IMD and Mumbai Municipal Corporation is installing a new dense rain-gauge network over Mumbai City with 200 rain-gauges. Four X-band radars will be also installed so that a merged rainfall data set at 2 km resolution will be prepared and made available to public in real time. “*This facility will help the city administration and general public to know the prevailing rainfall situation in the city on real time basis. For this purpose, already a mobile App has been developed,*” added Dr. Vardhan.

Eight new District Agro Meteorological Field Units (DAMUs) have been established in addition to the existing 130 Agro Meteorological Field Units. Block level Agro Meteorological forecasts have started in 200 blocks.
