NITI Aayog’s Atal Innovation Mission (AIM) and Drona Aviation, an IIT Bombay start-up, launched the ‘ATL Drone module: Get, Set, Go’ for Atal Tinkering Labs at the ongoing Aero India 2019 in Bengaluru. The ATL Drone Module was launched by Dr. G Satish Reddy, Chairman, DRDO and Sanjay Jaju, Joint Secretary, Department of Defence Production,, along with. Apurva Godbole, CEO, Drona Aviation and representatives of AIM.

“With the ATL Drone Module, young students of India will learn how to create their own drones and use them for solving community problems in India”, said Amitabh Kant, CEO, NITI Aayog.

“In the age of the Fourth industrial revolution, drones are one of the most promising technologies integrating the concepts of physics, maths, chemistry, engineering and sensor technologies creating a tremendous range of innovative solutions that can be developed using them”, said R Ramanan, Mission Director, AIM.

The ATL Drone Module aims at building the open source community of tinkerers who will learn and build on drone ideas to showcase their many possible applications. “Created with iterations and feedback from hundreds of students and teachers over the last three years, we hope that this module can be the spark and twig to start the fire of drone revolution in our country”, said Godbole.
