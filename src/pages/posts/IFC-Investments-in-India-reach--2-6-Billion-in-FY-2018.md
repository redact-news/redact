IFC, a member of the World Bank Group, has invested $2.6 billion in India in FY2018 — a rise of 136 percent over the figure two years ago — in the key priority areas of infrastructure, logistics, inclusion, and sustainability.

Many milestones were crossed in the year: Investments in infrastructure crossed $1 billion for the first time, and climate-related investments, too, crossed $1 billion to touch a record high. Besides, IFC’s work in the area of distressed assets has the potential to address 12 percent to 15 percent of India’s non-performing assets.

India is currently IFC’s largest country with an investment portfolio of $6.1 billion, which is 11% of the global committed portfolio. India is also IFC’s largest equity exposure, and the largest advisory client.

These investments are all long-term, made over 40 engagements with partners ranging from new-age start-ups, such as Coverfox and Bizongo, to established names such as Mahindra & Mahindra and HDFC. This is an all-time high and addresses development gaps through select and systemic interventions in affordable housing, small and medium enterprises, distressed assets, technology start-ups, logistics, agriculture, renewable energy, and sustainable mobility. These sectors will remain the cornerstones of IFC’s investment and advisory activities in India in the years to come.

“*As we complete six decades in India, we continue to believe in the country’s fundamentals and want to spur growth that is inclusive, sustainable, and fast,*” said **Mengistu Alemayehu**, Director, South Asia, IFC.

In addition to the investments, IFC’s advisory teams worked with several arms of the government at the Centre and in states to address key issues. IFC’s public-private-partnership (PPP) team led solutions for renewable energy storage, cleaning the Ganga, structuring innovative transactions for renewable energy, and much more.

“*We will continue to play a pioneering role in India, resolving the remaining challenges of inclusion and access by providing sustainable private-sector solutions,*” said **Alemayehu**.
