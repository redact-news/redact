Ukraine will showcase its Аn-132-D transport aircraft at Aero India, taking place in Bangalore from February 20 to 24, 2019. During the event Ukraine is planning to introduce the An-132-D as a potential future replacement for the Indian Air Force’s large An-32 fleet that is still in service.

An-132-D will carry out two demonstration flights during the air show.

The Indian Air Force (IAF) was the launch customer for the An-32 in the 1970s. The IAF bought 125 aircraft of which 105 are still in service. The entire fleet is undergoing modernisation. 35 upgraded An-32s have been delivered by Ukrspetsexport. The upgrades include modern avionics equipment, new oxygen systems and improved crew seats. The remaining aircraft are being upgraded in India.

The Antonov/Taqnia An-132 is an improved version of the Antonov An-32 twin-engined turboprop military transport aircraft developed jointly by Saudi Arabia and Ukraine. The Royal Saudi Air Force has reportedly ordered six planes.

The An-132 is powered by two Pratt & Whitney Canada PW150 turboprop engines, and features Honeywell avionics, a Liebherr air management system and a Hamilton Sundstrand-supplied Auxiliary Power Unit (APU).

Ukraine will also showcase new equipment and weapons which could interest the Indian armed forces — A new **counter-battery radar**, a **deep radar modernization project**, **missiles for “Pechora” S-125 system**, and other defensive products.

A high-level Ukrainian delegation will visit the international air show.

On February 13, First Deputy to the Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine **Oleg Hladkovskiy** held a meeting with Ambassador of India to Ukraine **Partha Satpathy**, during which the parties discussed possible ways of expanding military-technical cooperation, in particular, in the aviation sphere.

In addition, Mr. Hladkovskiy confirmed Ukraine’s interest in strategic cooperation with India in the export of military- and aviation-related products, as well as the provision of services for the repair and modernization of equipment for the needs of defense agencies. Also, according to him, the Ukrainian side is fully open for joint projects in military-technical cooperation under the program Make in India.

First Deputy to the Secretary of the NSDC of Ukraine stressed that India today can expand its bilateral cooperation with Ukraine as a country-developer of high-tech equipment and armaments, in particular, gas turbine engines for ships, aircraft engines, and modern armored vehicles. Issues of expanding cooperation will also be discussed during meetings within the framework of the international exhibition.
