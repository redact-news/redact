Airbus subsidiaries Navblue and Aerial have signed contracts with three Indian startups that are providing solutions in aeronautical data services, flight operations and imagery services. The three startups were accelerated at Airbus Bizlab in Bangalore, India.

1.  Navblue signed up Stelae Technologies to enhance aeronautical data services quality and consistency while enabling faster introduction to the market of the next generation fully data-driven and connected EFB (Electronic Flight Bag) solution. The company has developed a software for transforming unstructured documents to structured, searchable and analyzable outputs like Json (for Big Data), S1000d and ATA (for Aerospace and Defence) and DITA (for Manufacturing).
2.  Airbus Aerial and Navi Mumbai-based Airpix signed an agreement for a joint go-to market partnership in India to provide geo-analytic solutions and imagery services in the country. The company offers customized 3D drone data analytics, automated data interpretation, aerial data visualization and measurement solutions.
3.  Navblue also extended its agreement with Eflight for providing a comprehensive service solution to the Indian business aviation market. Founded in 2015, it has evolved from being an ATC flight planning company to a complete trip support company. Airbus had signed an agreement with Eflight in February 2018.

Airbus had also signed an agreement with Bangalore based Neewee in February 2018.

**Airbus Aerial** focuses on developing new imagery services to offer actionable data and analysis of information provided by drones, satellites, high altitude aircraft and other sources. **Navblue** is an integrated Flight Operations and Air Traffic Management Services company providing end-to-end flight operations solutions. Navblue is one of the first internal successes of the Bizlab process.

“*Navblue believes in India’s potential for multiple reasons. One is India’s proven capacity for innovation within the IT sector, which is demonstrated perfectly by the start-ups present at the Airbus’ BizLab, with whom we work very closely. Another is the potential of the aerospace industry; India has the world’s fastest-growing domestic airline market,*” said **Fabrice Villaumé**,  Chief Strategy and Innovation Officer at Navblue.

#### Expansion of Airbus Bizlab

The Bizlab in Bangalore was Airbus’ first one outside Europe. Considering its success Airbus Bizlab is now expanding its international footprint and partnerships to South Africa, Israel, Ivory Coast and UAE and reinforcing its existing network in Saint-Nazaire, Marignane, Munich and Bremen. The Airbus Bizlab will also design and setup an open-source collaborative platform.

“*Timeline for expansion not precise. One way or another we need to be present in Israel particularly in Cybersecurity and AI,*” said **Bruno Gutierres**, Global Head, Airbus BizLab.

Airbus BizLab’s start-up acceleration programme is in line with the Indian government’s ‘*Make in India*’ and ‘*Startup India*’ initiatives. It is a part of Airbus’ strategy to bring start-ups and Airbus “intrapreneurs” together to work and speed up the transformation of their innovative ideas into viable businesses. It has a community of around 2000 B2B start-ups from India, South East Asia and Israel.

“*For Airbus, India is a well of entrepreneurship, which is why outside Toulouse, Hamburg, Madrid (the other Bizlabs) we chose Bangalore to set up our first and our only Bizlab outside Europe. The Bizlab is now working with Startup India, to create the B2B community of startups alive with exchange and mentorship. Seen from Europe where we have our roots, ‘Make in India’ means embracing the magic of what we will call ‘Not Invented Here’* [*\**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here) *and making it a major ingredient of Airbus’s excellence and future prosperity,*” said **Pierre de Bausset** — President, Airbus Group India.

The season three cohort of the BizLab include *Zasti* (Deep learning pattern recognition), *Cats Global* (real time structural monitoring), *Block Armour* (blockchain for cyber security), *Orxa Energies* (Electric vehicles and battery technology), *Napeazy* (facilitating multiple sleeping postures for seated passengers) and *Airpix Geoanalytics* (Solar powered Low Altitude Long Endurance UAS) from India.

Other startups in the cohort include *Neuron SW* (predictive maintenance using AI sound analysis), *BroadBit Batteries* (sodium based battery technology), *SkyBuys* (duty free eCommerce), *Iridium Dynamics* (Hover-capable fixed wing drone), *eSmart Ground Services* (Aircraft data broadcasting), *Safetyn* (life preservation systems), *Bizpay* (instalment plans for airline tickets), *Cardshade* (custom airplane window shades), *AvatAir* (communications technology for supplier relations), *Listen Leon* (Smartphone app), *Crowdcraft* (crowd-sourcing and co-creation platform) and *Waste app* (airbus internal mobile app).

“*Four years ago, I was the head of the space division of Airbus travelling to Bangalore almost every year for more than 15 years. We had a reflection within the executive committee of Airbus to draw conclusions about the major changes that were occurring in the aerospace industry — first, the incredible speed of digitalisation, which could completely change our business model and second, the disruption coming from the use of outside technologies and business models. The conclusion of that was to speed the initiatives in order to access additional and different innovation ecosystems. That’s when we decided on the creation and the spread of the Bizlabs, the creation of a kind of laboratory of disruption and the creation of Airbus Ventures,*” said **Francois Auque**, Chairman of the Board of Airbus Ventures.

As part of the Take Off programme, Airbus BizLab will sponsor two travels to Europe for Indian start-ups in a period of six months as well as fund up to 50,000 euros to them for the demonstration of proof of concept (PoC).

Through its six-month “acceleration programme” for start-ups and internal projects, Airbus Bizlab gives access to coaches, experts and mentors in various domains.

In two years the Bizlab has accelerated **16 startups** in India and has **five success stories** to its credit. Overall, the accelerated startups have raised around **$1.5 million**. **Nine PoCs** are in the process of being readied by the accelerated startups.

“*For the last couple of years I have been convinced with the potential and the quality of entrepreneurs in India. I am pleased to see that all these partnerships between Airbus and Indian startups are proving me right,*” said **Bruno Gutierres**.

#### Airbus Ventures zeroing in on Indian Startups

Airbus Ventures has a few Indian startups on its radar for potential investment. So far it has invested in 23 startups in the Silicon Valley, Europe and Israel.

“*We are very seriously considering other areas and particularly India because we are really impressed by the policy, which has been started and implemented so quickly by the Indian government — Startup India and Invest India. We are using the networks which have been developed by the Bizlab in order to build our potential flow of investment. The Bizlab helps us to identify opportunities and to build relations with the relevant VC funds. So we are in this phase of preparation and I’m very hopeful that we will be able to identify opportunities for investment,*” said **Francois Auque**, Chairman of the Board of Airbus Ventures.

“*Airbus Ventures is a venture capital fund with one single shareholder- Airbus, It has been allocated $150 million to invest within four to five years in startups at a medium-early stage. We are looking at startups, which may not be in aerospace activity today, but because of their technologies, because of their business model can transform our industry tomorrow. So our mission is to invest in these kind of startups; to create links between these startups and airbus; and then first allowing Airbus to be aware of those ideas, second increasing the value of those startups thanks to the development of the relation with airbus,*” said **Francois Auque.**

#### “Make in India” & “Startup India”

With all major multinationals operating in India vying to demonstrate their commitment to ‘Make in India’, Airbus is not one to be left behind. Airbus has decided to tap uniquely Indian core competencies to work on its global solutions.

“*At Airbus when we say ‘Make in India’, we do not mean that we’re farming out things that our old folks don’t want to do anymore at home or because it is much cheaper to do it over here. We try to leverage minds and resourcefulness that are the trademark of India to tackle new questions that are critical to the future of the industry that are at the vanguard of the transformation of aviation and aerospace industry,*” said **Pierre de Bausset.**

“*The startup India action plan was launched in January 2016. There are three basic pillars around which the entire plan revolves — the first thing is providing easy funding to the startups. A whole corpus of 10000 crores of the fund of funds was placed under SIDBI. SIDBI in turn invests this money through AIFs (Alternative Investment Funds) into startups.* ***Around 1,200 crores have already been committed to more than 142 startups*** *which will be disbursed over time,*” said **Shruti Singh**, Director, Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion, Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Government of India. “*The second pillar would be how to increase innovation in the country. Under this programme NITI Ayog came up with the concept of Atal Tinkering Labs right down to school levels so that the students from class 9–12 could experiment, could tinker with equipment starting right in school. Other departments are supporting the growth of incubators across the country — MeitY, DST.*”

“*The third pillar — how is it the government should stay away; only with a soft touch to the entire growth story of startups. How is it that the government should come up with regulatory reforms to make the life of startups easy. We have an online portal called the Startup India Hub which gives free online courses to anybody who has doubts, anybody who wants to increase and give momentum to their business model. We have now more than 10,000 startups registered with us*,” she added.

“*For Airbus, strategy implies technology roadmaps, R&D funding and extensive demonstrators — it draws on innovation that is nurtured in house in Europe and also in the Silicon Valley and Shenzhen — different outposts that we have. But really the future opportunities that we have.. the future is sourced in our four Bizlabs and it is supported by Airbus Ventures, including India and specifically here in Bangalore. Through the Bizlab, Airbus really connects innovators, entrepreneurs at heart with the people that have a problem to solve and with the best experts that we have to ensure their ideas transform into a valuable business,*” added **Pierre de Bausset**.

#### Aerospace : Startup to Structured Industry — **Pierre de Bausset**

A*erospace is a very structured industry and seemingly unassailable from the outside. That’s because of its complex socio, economic, technology ecosystem, the capital and the R&D needs and the very large regulation that is there to serve exacting safety requirements.*

*But actually that’s not how aerospace came along. In fact in Toulouse which is the hometown of Airbus, one of our forefathers,* ***Clément Ader****, is credited for realising the first engine powered flight 128 years ago (1890). Clément Ader was not an aerospace engineer because there was no such thing. Actually he was a mechanical engineer and an electrical engineer and out of curiosity he read studies on the flight of birds. He was also quite an inventor and he improved on Graham Bell’s telephone. He introduced stereophony. What he really liked to do is to put together what he knew, what others had studied and what he thought were the nagging problems of the time. Now that is quite familiar because that is exactly what has been driving us over here; that kind of spirit. In fact over a 128 years we have really refined the science of flight quite a lot and of course adjacent fields of knowledge.*

*Air travel has become ubiquitous because it has become important and all this because we have never stopped cross pollinating different technologies and seeking new frontiers and new problems to solve. So today it is digitalization on the one hand and cooperative business models that are bringing a new revolution to aerospace. They affect the way we design, manufacture, affect airline operations, passenger experience and really disrupt the whole value chain.*
