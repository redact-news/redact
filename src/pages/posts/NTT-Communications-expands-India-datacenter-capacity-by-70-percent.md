NTT Communications Corporation (NTT Com), the ICT solutions and international communications business within the NTT Group (NYSE:NTT), has launched two new high-density and hyperscale datacenters in Mumbai and Bangalore, through its wholly owned Indian subsidiary — **Netmagic**.

These new datacenters in Mumbai and Bangalore are operational with some marquee anchored customers on-board already.

NTT Communications has invested **$ 144 million** to set up the two datacenters. Mumbai DC 6 was built with an investment of $ 80 million and Bangalore DC 3 was built with an investment of $ 64 million.

NTT Communications and Netmagic together employ 1350 people in India, of which 1250 are Netmagic employees. Netmagic has already employed 50 people in the new Mumbai datacenter and another 50 in the Bangalore datacenter. By 2020 the company aims to employ 1500 people in the country.

Netmagic’s Mumbai datacenter (DC 6) will offer 7,900 m2 of server room area (equivalent to 2,750 racks), and the Bangalore Datacenter (DC 3) will offer 5,700 m2 of server room area (equivalent to 1,500 racks). These two facilities will expand NTT Com’s datacenter capacity (server room) in India by 70 percent.

Mumbai DC 6 is now Netmagic’s largest datacenter in the country and it is already 90 percent booked. The first phase of its Bangalore DC 3 is 70 percent booked; one floor of DC 3 can accommodate around 200 racks with a power availability of 3 kw to 15 kw per rack.

The datacenters will offer colocation, managed dedicated hosting, Public/Private/Hybrid DR on cloud and managed services (RIM, IMS and managed security). “*Multi cloud is being used by banks in India. Manufacturing companies generally use a virtual private cloud for SAP Hanna. Large cloud operators and e-commerce companies typically chose collocation,*” said **Sunil Gupta**, Executive Director and President, Netmagic.

Netmagic will formally launch a **Cloud Management Platform** in October this year as a part of its multi-cloud strategy. As a super orchestration layer, it will be able to connect to services like AWS and Azure and customers can see all their instances on different cloud service providers and monitor their health. The platform is already being used by some of the company’s customers.

Netmagic is now a tier one partner to **AWS** and **Azure**. “*We are also becoming partners to other public cloud service providers who have set up shop in India,*” said **Sharad Sanghi**, MD & CEO, Netmagic (An NTT Communications Company). The company has a cloud-neutral vision.

“*These facilities are a part of our Nexcenter brand of Global datacenter services providing end-to-end ICT solutions combining datacenter/cloud, network and managed services, thereby, capitalizing on the trend of enterprises’ migrating their on-premise systems to the cloud,*” said **Takanobu Maeda**, Senior Vice President Global Business, Member of the Board, NTT Communications Corporation.

The “**Nexcenter**” branded datacenters will deliver Netmagic’s entire suite of services including Managed Colocation, Dedicated Hosting, Multi-Cloud, IT Infrastructure Monitoring & Management, Managed Security, Disaster Recovery and Managed App Hosting.

“*Given Mumbai’s and Bangalore’s business importance, Netmagic’s Mumbai DC 6 and Bangalore DC 3 are poised to become the very heart of India’s IT Infrastructure needs, offering the right platform for enterprises and start-ups alike, to grow, scale and innovate in order to take business to the next level,*” said **Sharad Sanghi**.

NTT Com, which offers Netmagic data centers in Mumbai, Bangalore, Delhi (Noida) and Chennai, opened its India Bangalore 2 Data Center in 2014 and India Mumbai 5 Data Center (Mumbai DC5) in 2015.

Netmagic completes 20 years on 30th July this year. “*Our journey started in Bangalore. Our first chairman BV Jagadish was from Bangalore. He was the first investor in Netmagic,*” said **Sharad Sanghi**.

India is Asia’s third-largest market for data center services, following only Japan and China, and market growth is averaging high annual rates of 25% to 30%. Data centers are using increasingly more data as large IT providers launch new cloud services for mobile internet, e-commerce, IoT and big data.

#### Features of Mumbai DC6 and Bangalore DC3

Mumbai DC6 is located close to the Mumbai International Airport (15 minutes by car) and is adjacent to NTT Com’s India Mumbai DC5. It will deliver services mainly for multiple Indian and foreign firms engaged in Internet, media and financial services. It has multiple power feeds from Tata Power, whose substation is located next to the facility.

Bangalore DC3, which is located in a data center-dedicated building in Whitefield in east Bangalore, will support companies engaged mainly in IT services and business process outsourcing (BPO) services for system development and operational management, both domestic and international. It has express feeders from BESCOM feeding its 66 KV power substation.

Netmagic used its own project managers and design team for the datacenters. The building contractor for Mumbai DC6 was Hiranandani and Bangalore DC3 was done by Bearys Group. Both were completed within 15 to 18 months from the time of land acquisition. UPS and chillers have been sourced from Schneider Electric while the cooling fitments were done by Sterling & Wilson (of the Shapoorji Pallonji Group). Both data centers boast of elaborate security infrastructure including a 14 feet high electrified compound wall.
