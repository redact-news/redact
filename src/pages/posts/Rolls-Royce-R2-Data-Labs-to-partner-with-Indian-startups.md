R2 Data Labs, Rolls-Royce’s \[*LON: RR*\] data innovation catalyst, plans to develop a collaborative ecosystem of digital partners in Bangalore, India. Rolls-Royce will provide mentoring and technical support to start-ups specialising in the areas of Advanced Analytics, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), Blockchain, Quantum Computing, Autonomous and Sensing.

“*Unlocking hidden value in data requires new technology but also new ways of thinking. Working with IoT start-ups helps us to accelerate digital transformation, deliver further value to customers, improve existing services and create new areas of growth. At the same time, we also get to help those innovators to succeed, and share in their pace, inventiveness and energy,*” said **Caroline Gorski**, Group Director of R2 Data Labs.

The initiative is in line with Rolls-Royce’s commitment to collaborative innovation and building an ecosystem of partners that harnesses the latest thinking and technologies from a wide community of innovators. Rolls-Royce has specifically chosen Bangalore to launch this program in India due to the growing number of technology companies there. According to recent reports, Bangalore is now ranked as the city with highest growth index for start-up hubs, followed by London and Tel Aviv. The city is one among the nine ‘International Start-up Hubs’ outside of the United States and the start-up capital of India.

“*Sitting at the heart of our vision for the digital age is a collaborative approach to innovation, where we actively look to develop new, radical ways of working to maintain our competitive edge. To this end, Rolls-Royce has been sponsoring, and collaborating with, niche technology startups in the areas of Artifical Intelligence, Big Data Analytics, Internet of Things (IoT), Application Development and Future Technologies across the world to help validate, build and grow their business,*” said **Caroline Gorski**, Group Director of R2 Data Labs.

“*The industrial domain is tightly contained and difficult to access. With our guidance we can help you navigate the space and develop your understanding of what it’s like to work alongside a leading industrial company. Our support means that you can stay in industrial tech and not pivot to another industry just because it’s easier to access. We also partner with our customers to help support and enhance their ideas and concepts. By sharing innovations with them, together we can make real strides forward in the industry — strides which wouldn’t be possible if we didn’t partner with one another,*” she adds.

“*Digital skills help accelerate India’s drive to develop its economy. The country’s vibrant digital ecosystem, supported by an innovative start-up environment, will facilitate the development of capabilities in these areas in the hope of creating immense opportunities across the lives of individuals and affect diverse industries including financial services, retail, media, travel, hospitality and healthcare,*” said **Kishore Jayaraman**, President, Rolls-Royce — India & South Asia.

Rolls Royce launched R2 Data Labs in 2017. Its ecosystem already includes over 500 partners from across Europe, India, USA and Asia-Pacific. From undertaking research into Industrial Artificial Intelligence with The Alan Turing Institute, supporting start-up accelerators like IoT Tribe, Seraphim Space Camp and Startupbootcamp, R2’s Ecosystem is generating insights and value from data.

“*We recognise that some of the best digital capabilities exist outside of our business. For Rolls-Royce to continue to pioneer the power that matters as a leading industrial technology company and be a strong industrial partner, we must champion collaboration. As a leader in applied industrial AI and analytics applications, R2 Data Labs is tasked to help Rolls-Royce become the ‘go-to’ industrial company,*” said **Kishore Jayaraman**, President, Rolls-Royce — India & South Asia.

*“Rolls-Royce has more than 20 years of experience combining engineering expertise with data analytics, offering operational efficiencies to airline customers. Building on these foundations, Rolls-Royce is expanding its digital capabilities to deliver increased value from existing services and introduce new services to customers across the group,*” read a communiqué from the company.

R2 works with Venture Capital funds, accelerators and other innovation networks to scout out and qualify external partners to help us solve its challenges.

Through its global events, R2 in 2018 invited innovators to challenge how data is used in the aviation industry, while another looked at the use of digital technologies to assess propulsion system damage.

Bangalore is one of the nine international startup hubs, along with Berlin, London and Singapore, where Rolls-Royce is augmenting technological capacities.
