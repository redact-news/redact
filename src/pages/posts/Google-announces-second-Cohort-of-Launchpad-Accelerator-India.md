Google Launchpad Accelerator India, which opened applications in the end of 2018, has announced the names of 10 startups which will form the second batch of the program. The final 10 selected startups operate out of cities across India including Bangalore, Mumbai and New Delhi.

Similar to the first class, these 10 handpicked startups will get access to the best of Google and will undergo an intensive one-week mentorship bootcamp, followed by further in-person engagements over the next three months. Throughout the program, startups will also be supported virtually on their specific needs.

“*The first class of Launchpad Accelerator India was hugely exciting and the process was as much of a learning experience for us as it was for the startups. Given the growing maturity of India’s startups our program focuses on providing startups with incremental knowledge and tools, gleaned from our experience of building products for users around the world. For the second class, we aim to provide a sharply targeted program, designed around the challenges of India, and how technologies like AI and ML can be leveraged to address their scale and complexity. Through Launchpad Accelerator India, the idea is to innovate and iterate with products in the crucible of India, to build solutions that are globally relevant,*” said **Paul Ravindranath G**, Program Manager, Launchpad Accelerator Program, India, Google.

Launchpad Accelerator India is modelled on Google’s global Launchpad Accelerator program, and is dedicated to support Indian startups that use technologies like machine learning and artificial intelligence to create solutions that address India’s core needs.

“*We are pleased to announce that the next cohort of startups has been selected for our upcoming programs in Africa, Brazil, and India. We reviewed over 1,000 applications for these programs, and were thoroughly impressed with the quality of startups that indicated their interest. The startups chosen represent those using technology to create a positive impact on key industries in their region and we look forward to supporting them and connecting them with startup ecosystems around the world,*” said **Roy Glasberg**, Founder of Launchpad Accelerator. “*In Africa, we have selected 12 startups from 6 African countries for our 3rd class in this region. In India, for our 2nd class, we are focused on seed to growth-stage startups that operate across a number of sectors using ML and AI to solve for India-specific problems.
