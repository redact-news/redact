Motorcycle and scooter manufacturer Hero MotoCorp has set up its first Research and Development (R&D) Centre at a global location — the Hero Tech Centre Germany GmbH.

A wholly-owned subsidiary of Hero MotoCorp Limited — the new Centre of technology — located at *Stephanskirchen* near Munich in Germany — will operate in tandem with Hero’s Global R&D hub, the Centre of Innovation and Technology (CIT) in Jaipur, in the northern Indian state of Rajasthan.

To begin with, the Hero Tech Centre Germany GmbH — which will be under the direct supervision of **Dr. Markus Braunsperger**, Chief Technology Officer (CTO) at Hero MotoCorp — will focus on development of new vehicle concepts and future technologies in close cooperation with the teams at CIT in Jaipur. It will also be the epicentre for Hero’s motorsport team — the Hero MotoSports Team Rally — and will facilitate all rally participation activities, including new product development for the Team.

“*Setting up of the Hero Tech Centre Germany GmbH is a realisation of our aspiration to build an R&D eco-system that is spread across global geographies. Ever since Hero began its solo journey in 2011, we have had a clear and focused plan to enhance and strengthen our technological know-how and product development capabilities. We set up the Centre of Innovation and Technology (CIT) in Jaipur in 2016 and since then, this facility has been designing and developing a range of new mobility solutions for customers across the globe,*” said **Dr. Pawan Munjal**, Chairman, Hero MotoCorp. “*The Hero Tech Centre in Germany will be a source of modern technologies with a focus on the global customer base, thereby further strengthening our R&D capabilities. The Tech Centre will also enable us to easily tap into the huge pool of resources readily available across Europe and merge them with our ongoing operations at the CIT.*”

Hero MotoCorp also engages with global design and technology houses from Italy, Spain and Thailand.

The company capped-off the Calendar Year (CY) 2018 by selling 8,039,472 motorcycles and scooters in the January-December period. For the Financial Year (FY) 2019, the cumulative sales of the Company in the nine month period (Apr-Dec 2018), has now risen to 6,037,901 units.
