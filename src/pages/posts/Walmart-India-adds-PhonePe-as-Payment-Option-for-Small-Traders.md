PhonePe’s digital payment solutions complement other physical and digital payment options offered at Best Price Stores and make UPI payments available for the first time at Best Price Cash & Carry stores. With UPI, Walmart India members can instantly pay for their purchases directly from their bank account via PhonePe without sharing their bank details.

“*This initiative reiterates our commitment to help kiranas and other small businesses to prosper. UPI is the fasting-growing type of digital payment in India, providing convenience and a seamless experience to users. The PhonePe payment system will help our members streamline their business processes and spend more time in their stores with customers. By using PhonePe in our B2B cash-&-carry stores, our members are contributing to India’s growth as an efficient digital economy,*” said **Krish Iyer**, President & CEO, Walmart India.

“*We have been working closely with the Walmart India team to deepen our ties, and the launch of PhonePe’s payment solutions in Best Price Stores and on bestprice.in, the B2B e-commerce platform, is a step in that direction. PhonePe has been aggressively expanding its merchant network among small businesses to enable them to accept digital payments. With this partnership, we will be able to help these businesses digitize all their payment transactions — from taking payments from consumers to paying at Best Price Stores for their own purchases,*” said **Sameer Nigam**, CEO & Founder, PhonePe.
