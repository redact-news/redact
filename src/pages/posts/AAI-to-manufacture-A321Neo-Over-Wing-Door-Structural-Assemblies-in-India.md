Aerostructures Assemblies India Pvt. Ltd. (AAI), a joint Venture between Aequs Aerospace and Saab AB, has been awarded a contract from Saab Aerostructures to manufacture the structural assembly for the Over Wing Doors (OWD) on the Airbus A321neo program. Production deliveries will begin at the end of 2019 and ramp up in subsequent years.

The structural assembly is comprised of machined aluminium parts which will be assembled by the AAI team in Belagavi, Karnataka, India and delivered to the Saab Aerostructures Assembly Line in Linköping, Sweden.

The Over Wing Doors are a critical part of the aircraft used for emergency exits. There are 4 Over Wing Doors on the A321Neo aircraft.

It is a result of hard work and joint efforts and we are pleased to both support the growth of the company and Airbus’ position in India with this award,*” said **Lars Jensen**, Vice President and Managing Director of Saab Aerostructures.
