Eaton’s new site in Bangalore will manufacture standard hose assemblies and serve commercial, business and regional aircraft customers. The product manufactured at the site will also provide customers with a dual source for Eaton’s oil debris monitoring systems.

“*India has an untapped potential to fuel our Aerospace business’s market growth in the APAC region,*” said **Nitin Chalke**, president, Vehicle and Hydraulics, APAC, Eaton. “*The upcoming site reinforces Eaton’s continued commitment to India.
