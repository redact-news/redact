R Madhavan, Chairman and Managing Director, Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) today called upon Indian Aerospace and Aviation industry sector to emulate the ‘Israeli model’ where they specifically develop and manufacture products not only for their domestic needs but also fully focus on the global markets.

“*Considering the huge global market that the Aerospace and Aviation industry offers, India needs to look more on the export market as we have the requisite technology, skilled manpower, low cost base and system integration capabilities to cater to the global markets,*” said **Madhavan**, while delivering the keynote address at the Conclave on Aviation Industry organised by Bangalore Chamber of Industry and Commerce (BCIC) in Bangalore.

“*If Indian aerospace companies need to tap a sizeable chunk of the global market, then they need to look at forming a consortium of MSMEs under the wings of a major aerospace player like HAL. It will be easy to tap and capture the global market pie. We need to work on this model,*” he added.

“*India is emerging as one of the largest Aerospace–Aviation markets of the world. Global Aerospace Aviation majors are eyeing India to set up Manufacturing, Design Engineering, MRO facilities leveraging India’s low labour cost, young and talented pool of Engineers, Technologists, Designers etc.” He further added: “Skilled manpower is most critical and vital for the development of a High-Tech industry like Aerospace and Aviation. This has been recognised by the Chamber in full measure. To this end BCIC has pro-actively pursued with the NSDC and has set up a Sector Skill Council in the field of Aerospace and Aviation at Bangalore; Bangalore being the aviation capital of the country,*” said **Kishore Alva**, President BCIC & Joint President and Executive Director, Adani — Udupi Power Corporation Ltd.

“*Defence Procurement Policy makes it mandatory to have a minimum of 30% offsets obligation. As per current indication the generated defence offsets in the next 10–15 years would be in the range of USD 30 Billion. Offsets will facilitate export of manufactured aeronautical products, software packages, engineering services, creation of joint ventures, infrastructures, etc. Joint Ventures / Strategic Partnerships recommended for Offset Liquidation. It is here India particularly Karnataka can take advantage of the huge opportunities it offers in the coming years,*” said **Ashok Saxena**, Chairman, Aerospace Aviation Expert Committee, BCIC. He emphasised that Indian MSME sector in aerospace has to proactively work on enhancing their competencies, capabilities, competitiveness to get integrated and become part of global supply chain of aerospace-aviation industry. He also requested industry professional bodies and the Government agencies to provide necessary support and assistance to achieve the objectives.
