The US-India Strategic Partnership Forum (USISPF) facilitated a high-level US delegation to Bangalore led by Vikram Singh, Senior Advisor, Defense and Aerospace at USISPF and Former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for South and Southeast Asia. The agenda focused on key Government of India defense priorities and ways in which U.S. industry can actively support the partnership between the two countries.

“*The U.S.and India are ready to take defense ties to the next level as partners in high tech defense innovation by partnering with startups and entrepreneurs in both countries,*” said **Vikram J. Singh**. “*American companies, investors and the US government showed a terrific commitment to this goal at Aero India 2019,*” he added.

The delegation kicked off on Tuesday with an industry reception featuring Ambassador Kenneth I. Juster, U.S. Ambassador to India; Alan Shaffer, Deputy Undersecretary for Acquisition & Sustainment; Lieutenant General Charles Hooper, Director of the Defense Security Cooperation Agency; along with other visiting U.S. government dignitaries.

Immediately post the Inaugural Session, the Forum hosted an event on **Anti-Drone Technology**, which included key leaders from the Indian Army and technology sectors. The seminar featured discussions on how India can develop counter drone technologies, after recent incidents that have threatened security and disrupted airport travels. As drones continue to pose growing security threats to both civilian and military entities, a new market for anti-drone technology is emerging. To date, over 200 anti-drone products are either in the market or under active development. Considering this growing threat, USISPF program generated interest, including participation from other countries such as Israel and Finland.  
   
In addition, USISPF co-hosted a seminar in partnership with India’s Ministry of Defense called “**Start-up Manthan**.” The event featured U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for South and Southeast Asia, **Dr. Joe Felter** along with senior officials from Indian Ministry of Defense. The program discussed in detail the IDEX incubator that has been launched in India and learnings from the U.S. experience in developing an innovation ecosystem.  
   
USISPF also hosted meetings with the Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, the Minister of State for Defense Dr. Subhash Rao Bhamra, Deputy Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal, VR Chaudhari, AVSM VM and Defense Secretary Sanjay Mitra.

Headquartered in Washington D.C., USISPF has offices in New York, Silicon Valley, Mumbai and New Delhi.
