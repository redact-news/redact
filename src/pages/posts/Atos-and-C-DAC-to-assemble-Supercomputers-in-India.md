Atos has announced a 3 year contract with India’s C-DAC (Centre for Development of Advanced Computing), an organisation within the MeitY (Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology, India) to supply its direct liquid cooled BullSequana supercomputers. Delivery is expected to start early 2019. According to sources the contract represents several tens of millions of euros in business for the company.

The supercomputers will be assembled in India by Atos teams however the contract does not envisage any technology transfer. Atos will source the components from France and assemble the supercomputers in Chennai.

In the first phase Atos and C-DAC will assemble the computers in India at an outlay of Rs 68 crore. In the second phase certain components like the motherboards would be manufactured locally while in the third phase C-DAC will design the supercomputer locally.

The company has been present in India for about ten years with engineering centres and in the industrial assembly for supercomputers. Atos has a supercomputer and server design centre in Bangalore.

This contract is part of the NSM (National Supercomputing Mission), a 7-year plan of INR 4500 crores (~650M$) led by the Government of India which aims to create a network of over 70 high-performance supercomputing facilities for various academic and research institutions across India.

For the project Atos will deploy its **BullSequana** supercomputers, with a cumulative computing power of more than 10 petaflops. These supercomputers, including the recently announced BullSequana XH2000 will be installed in various academic and research institutions. IIT-Kharagpur will get a 1.3 petaflop machine and IISER Pune and IIT-BHU will get a 650 teraflop computer each.

“*We are honoured to be given this opportunity by the Indian Authorities to be part of the NSM initiative and to become the technology partner of C-DAC for HPC-related platforms. We’re proud to be supporting India as one of the major markets with its strong growth expectations. The choice of the Indian government is testament to our experience and expertise in high-performance supercomputing and I am delighted that our BullSequana, with its unique Direct Liquid Cooling platform, will be enabling Indian academic and research institutions to accelerate their research,*” said **Pierre Barnabé**, Chief Operating Officer, Big Data & Security at Atos.

“*We would like to thank the Hon’ble Minister MEIT, Secretary MEIT and the Director General of C-DAC Dr. Hemant Darbari for giving this opportunity to participate in such a prestigious program. We are very excited and looking forward to this unique technology partnership with C-DAC. Besides delivery of the Make in India Supercomputers, the partnership will bring to bear cooperation in many emerging areas, including exascale computing, artificial intelligence and quantum computing,*” said **Arvind Bajaj**, Vice President and Head Big Data & Security at Atos in India.

In 2014 Atos, IT services provider at the time, entered the supercomputing sector with the acquisition of Bull, the French supercomputing vendor. It competes with American vendors IBM and Cray Computers, Fujitsu of Japan and some Chinese manufacturers.
