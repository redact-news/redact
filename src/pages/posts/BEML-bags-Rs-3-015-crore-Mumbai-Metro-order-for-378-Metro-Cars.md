BEML has earlier supplied metro coaches in smaller numbers, along with an international company as a JV partner. It has now sub-contracted Hitachi for certain designs. The coaches will be manufactured in the BEML factory at Bangalore.

This is one of the largest orders of metro rail coaches in the recent times. The award price per coach which is less than Rs. 8 crores (including spares, design, installation, and commissioning) is the lowest in recent times. Seven International manufacturers of rolling stock : Alstom, Bombardier, CAF, CRRC, Titagarh, BEML, Hyundai Rotem, participated in the bid.

The project is being assisted by Asian Development Bank and the procurement has been done following their guidelines and concurrence. Metro line 2A will connect Dahisar to DN Nagar in Mumbai. Metro line 2B will run further from DN Nagar to Mankhurd via Bandra, and Metro line 7 from Dahisar to Andheri (east).

The stainless steel body, air-conditioned coaches, with 4 doors on each side, will have a carrying capacity of 300 passengers. It will be equipped with CCTV surveillance for passenger security and real-time track monitoring. These driverless trains will operate on 25 KV AC traction and will feature a regenerative braking system.

India’s Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) has standardised the specifications for metro rolling-stock, signalling, telecom, electrical and civil components. It has also adopted the Public Procurement Order, Make in India (PPO/MII) 2017, for metro rail systems. MoHUA has also stipulated that minimum 75% of the coaches procured against any tender have to be manufactured in India. Alstom, Bombardier, BEML, and Titagarh have setup manufacturing units in India. As a result of the “Make in India” initiatives, the last two big procurement orders for rolling stock in India, floated on international competitive bidding model, have gone to Indian companies.

Today about 536 kms of metro lines are operational in 10 different cities in India : Delhi & NCR (317 km), Bangalore, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Chennai, Jaipur, Kochi, Lucknow, Mumbai and Gurugram. In addition, more than 650 kms of metro rail projects are under construction in Delhi & NCR, Mumbai, Kolkata, Bangalore, Chennai, Kochi, Jaipur, Hyderabad, Nagpur, Ahmedabad, Lucknow, Pune, Bhopal and Indore. Many more cities are also planning to adopt metro rail systems for mass transit.
