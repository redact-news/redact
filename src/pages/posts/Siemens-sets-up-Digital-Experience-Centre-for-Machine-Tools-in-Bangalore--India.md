Siemens has set up a Digital Experience and Application Centre (DEX), a testing, simulation and training centre for the machine tool industry, in Bangalore today. Spread across 9,000 square feet, the centre allows machine tool manufacturers and users to experience the integrations of hardware with software solutions as well as that of the physical with virtual worlds.

It is equipped with machine tool solutions from Siemens and partners, including machine tool builders, probe manufacturers, tooling suppliers, CAD / CAM solution providers, etc. The Center will support machine tool builders, dealers and educational institutes through knowledge sharing programs, application support, training and many such initiatives. It also features a live demonstration of robots with SINUMERIK CNC controllers, which act as an interface for the robot for gantry, pick and place, robotic machining and other applications.

“*India is set to become a key player in the global machine tools industry and is likely to see substantial high-end machine tool manufacturing. With our Digital enterprise portfolio, we provide the foundation for the machine tool industry to adopt Industry 4.0 and move into digital manufacturing, from product design, planning, engineering, execution and digital services. Siemens Digital Experience and Application Center is a vital link in unlocking the potential of Industry 4.0 and enabling Indian Machine tool manufactures to transform and set global benchmarks,*” said **Vijay Pratap Singh**, Head of Motion Control business, Digital Factory, Siemens India.

Machine tool professionals can simulate and co-create efficient machining strategies, from machine design to engineering and commissioning, and improve productivity in real-world conditions using Siemens’ digitalisation portfolio. The end users can have their manufacturing processes optimised from the design stage to execution until services of their final product. The facility also demonstrates the connectivity solution of shop floor to the top floor within the premises as well as MindSphere (cloud-based, open IoT operating system from Siemens).
