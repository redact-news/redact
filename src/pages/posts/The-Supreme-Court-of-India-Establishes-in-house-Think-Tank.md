The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of India Ranjan Gogoi has established an in-house think-tank at the highest constitutional court in the country. In order to strengthen the knowledge infrastructure of the Supreme Court and enhance its capacity to meet its increasing knowledge needs the Chief Justice of India has redefined the role and function of the Supreme Court’s **Centre for Research and Planning** (CRP) and entrusted it with a new mandate.

The main mandate of the think tank would be to carry out cutting edge research into fundamental jurisprudence and principles and doctrines of law as well as on judicial reforms for improvement in justice delivery and judicial independence. A focal point of its research will be the contribution of the Supreme Court of India to the development of law.

“*To this end, CRP will Carry out its own research as well as harness research relevant to the judicial system. CRP will create a network of leading independent scholars in key domain areas. CRP will create a permanent and accessible database of relevant knowledge through a series of publications, working papers, thematic briefs and case notes. CRP will also prepare summaries of key judgements of the Supreme Court for general audiences in non-technical language. CRP will conduct periodic seminars on doctrinal issues and engage with members of the Bar engaged in academic work, especially its younger members. CRP’s focus will be on meta themes and issues and on individual adjudication. CRP’s work will be independent and free of bias, presenting all major points of view. To maximise transparency and ensure wide dissemination of its work, all key outputs of CRP will be posted on a public web site,*” read a communiqué from the court.

#### **The Context: Fast Expanding Knowledge Needs Of the Judiciary**

The knowledge needs of the judiciary are rapidly expanding. The range, content and complexity of issues that are adjudicated in our courts is growing exponentially. Courts have to deal with a constantly growing body of new legislation and administrative regulation including on highly specialised matters. Courts are increasingly becoming the forum of choice for adjudication of sensitive, complex and tangled social, economic and political questions. Citizens, in particular marginalised sections are increasingly and rightfully asserting their legal and constitutional rights. International law is playing an increasing role in our litigation and foreign judgements are being cited by lawyers and academics as guidance. In a dynamic and fast changing society there is constant need for jurisprudential adaptation, innovation and evolution. There is a burgeoning body of academic research and writing on various aspects of courts and on law which needs to be effectively bridged to the judicial system. Knowledge is also vital for reforming and modernising the judicial system to improve the quality, timeliness, responsiveness, efficiency and effectiveness of justice delivery.

#### **The Response — Strengthening the Knowledge Infrastructure of the Judiciary**

To meet these knowledge needs, the judiciary requires a strong knowledge and intellectual infrastructure and the systematisation and institutionalisation of processes and methods for acquiring, generating and managing legal and inter-disciplinary knowledge by courts.

The creation of an in-house think tank in the Supreme Court by the Chief Justice responds to these needs, complementing the network of national and state judicial academies that have been built over the last 15 years . The network creates and strengthens institutional knowledge as a resource for judges and also the broader legal community.
