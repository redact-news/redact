In the wake of increasing allegations of electronic voting machines (EVMs) being tampered with and news of their malfunctioning in the world’s largest democracy, state-run Bharat Electronics Ltd (BEL) has said that the EVMs have gained the confidence of the people and are time-tested with foreign countries expressing interest in using them.

**EVM**s and voter verifiable paper audit trail machines (**VVPAT**s) in India are manufactured by BEL and Electronics Corporation of India Ltd (**ECIL**). BEL and ECIL are the only two companies supplying EVMs to the Election Commission of India (EC).

BEL chairman and managing director **MV Gowtama** said that losing political parties tended to blame EVMs for their loss and that it was a case of ‘sour grapes.’ He said that the machines could malfunction due to different reasons but were non-tamperable.

BEL has started increasing the number of tests on its EVMs and is working on continuous improvement. The EVMs currently cost around INR 10,000. BEL, which is known for producing military-grade equipment, can reduce failure rate and increase availability of the EVMs. However this would result in a cost escalation of over three times the present cost.

Indian made EVMs were used in elections in **Namibia** and **Nepal** has also expressed interest in using them. BEL is keen to export EVMs, however the exported EVMs would have an embedded architecture different from the ones used in India. Officials of the company indicated that EVMs could be built to suit different electoral systems, like *proportional representation* where parties gain seats in proportion to the number of votes cast for them.

VVPATs were introduced as a confidence building measure. The Election Commission has decided to deploy VVPATs in all elections henceforth. This would translate to matching order quantities for VVPATs and EVMs to BEL and ECIL.

BEL has supplied 200,000 EVMs last fiscal and expects to supply 500,000 this fiscal. The company has a INR 3500 crore (35 billion) order for EVMs and VVPATs. BEL has scaled up production capacity of EVMs to around 50,000 units per month across 7 units.

### Financial Highlights for 2017–18

![](/images/BEL-reasserts-Infallibility-and-Robustness-of-Electronic-Voting-Machines/1*1mw5BVp2_GlCO0pdsHWAcQ.png)

*   Registered a **turnover growth of 14%** over previous year
*   Supply commenced for Ground Based Mobile ELINT System and Battlefield Surveillance System
*   Inauguration of BEL developed Online Inventory Management System for Indian Navy
*   Excellent “MoU” Rating for 2016–17
*   Turnover from **indigenous technology is 89%**
*   Sales from Defence business is 85%

The **decrease in profitability** is attributed to the company’s compliance with the third **pay revision commission** notification, **buy-back of shares** that resulted in reduced **cash reserves** and decreased earnings from **interest**, and the increase in tax (**GST**) from 24 to 28 percent.

### Export Performance

*   Achieved Export sales of US $ 26 Million
*   Major products include Coastal Surveillance System, CoMPASS, Advanced Composite Communication System, Electro Mechanical parts etc.
*   **Export order book** of US $ **92** Million as on April 1, 2018; includes **Offset order book** of US $ **35** Million
*   Raksha Mantri award for Best Performance in Exports for the year 2015–16
*   Participated in 3 International Exhibitions to showcase products & capabilities

#### Export Revenue impacted

BEL witnessed a drop in export revenue, from $ 65 million in 2016–17 to $ 26 million in 2017–18.

This plunge in export revenue this fiscal was attributed to the non-delivery of $ 30 million worth of import-substitution equipment, which is considered as deemed exports.

About $ 30 million worth of equipment was produced by BEL based on orders given by **Reliance Defence**, however financial constraints prevented the company from opening LCs (Letter of Credit) for delivery. The inspection authority — DGQA has accepted the system. Now BEL is exploring options to get the navy to directly take delivery of the produced equipment. Reliance Naval and Engineering (earlier known as Reliance Defence/Pipavav) had placed orders worth about $ 110 million on BEL for equipment to be installed in naval offshore patrol vessels (Project 21 NOPVs). The $30 million order is part of this larger order. It constitutes buyer nominated equipment to the manufacturers of the platform.

The company’s thermal wepon sights have been accepted by IWI, Israel and Beretta, Italy.

BEL has been invited for commercial and technical negotiations with **Oman** for the supply of Coastal Surveillance systems.
