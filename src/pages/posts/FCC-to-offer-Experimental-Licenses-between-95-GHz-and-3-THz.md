The US Federal Communications Commission has created a new category of experimental licenses for use of frequencies between 95 GHz and 3 THz. These licenses will give innovators the flexibility to conduct experiments lasting up to 10 years, and to more easily market equipment during the experimental period.

The Spectrum Horizons First Report and Order are intended to encourage the development of new communications technologies and expedite the deployment of new services in the spectrum above 95 GHz. This spectrum has long been considered the outermost horizon of the usable spectrum range, but rapid advancements in radio technology have made these bands especially ripe for new development.

“*Just like Mach 1 speeds, the airwaves above 95 GHz — extremely high-frequency, short-wavelength bands of spectrum — were previously thought to be unapproachable (in our case, for wireless applications). However, recent evolutions in technology have led us to look to these “spectrum horizons” for new services and applications, such as personal health monitoring systems, see-in-the dark imaging, and centimeter-level position, as mentioned in Professor Rappaport’s presentation,*” said **FCC Chairman Ajit Pai** in a statement.

It also makes a total of 21.2 gigahertz of spectrum available for use by unlicensed devices. The Commission selected bands with propagation characteristics that will permit large numbers of unlicensed devices to use the spectrum, while limiting the potential for interference to existing governmental and scientific operations in the above-95 GHz bands, such as space research and atmospheric sensing.

The First Report and Order provides opportunities for new experimental and unlicensed use in the frequencies above 95 GHz and will help ensure that the United States stays at the forefront of wireless innovation. Moreover, study of these uses could ultimately lead to further rule-making actions and additional licensing opportunities within the Spectrum Horizons bands.

“*These bands have their propagation challenges and, right now, we do not know what services they will support; but not too long ago people scoffed at the idea of commercial use in the millimeter waves. Therefore, I support allocating these frequencies for experimental and unlicensed use,*” said **Commissioner Michael O’Rielly**. “*While we are providing opportunities for the technologies of the future, there is still great need for spectrum to expand the unlicensed technologies of today. Two items that the Commission can and should move quickly on are: (1) revisiting the sordid history of the 5.9 GHz band and (2) taking the necessary steps to open the 6 GHz band for unlicensed use.*”

“*We don’t wait around for technologies to develop fully before unlocking spectrum so that entrepreneurs have the incentives to invest and experiment. You can see it with our steps in the 1980s to identify unlicensed spectrum, which years later allowed Wi-Fi to flourish. You can see it in the early 2000s when we freed up spectrum above 40 GHz, which is commonly used today for vehicle radar and other technologies. And you can see it when we opened up millimeter wave spectrum back when many still doubted that it could support 5G,*” said **Commissioner Brendan Carr** in a statement.

“*Today we put these stratospheric frequencies to use by adopting a new set of experimental rules for their operation. Access will be granted on a non-interfering basis, following federal coordination. In addition, we authorize unlicensed activity in a set of four bands and specify the power limits and out-of-band emission limits for their operation,*” said **Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel** in a statement. “*I believe that with these way-up-there frequencies, where the potential for interference is so low, we should flip the script. The burden should be on those seeking exclusive licenses to demonstrate the interference case and justify why we should carve up an otherwise open space for innovation and experimentation.*”
