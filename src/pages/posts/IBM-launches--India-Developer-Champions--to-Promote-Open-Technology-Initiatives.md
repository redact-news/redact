International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) has announced ‘India Developer Champions’, a new multi-year program that recognises developer contributions to the open source community.

“*IBM wants to put a spotlight on the 23 million developers and data scientists in the world who work across industries and who, through their creativity and skill, are making a real difference to society,*” said **Bob Lord**, IBM Senior Vice President, Cognitive Applications and Developer Ecosystems. Around 18 percent of these developers are from India. “*What this program is attempting to do is to spotlight those people that are having an impact on the world, specifically here in India. There are going to be 25 finalists, that’ll be elevated as top developer champions throughout India this year.*”

“*We’re here to enable the largest ecosystem possible,*”said **Ginni Rometty**, IBM chairperson, president and CEO, speaking at the IBM India Developer Day, the company’s annual developer conference in India.

Ginni Rometty reiterated IBM’s commitment to open source by outlining its key principles, highlighting the importance of open governance and the importance of giving back to the community. Two decades back, IBM, led by Louis Gerstner, invested $ 1 billion in Linux with a dedicated team of 1500 engineers.

“*There’s a very big fundamental principle that’s happening in development right now around open source; open source has always been very targeted towards the startup world and the development community at large. But now it’s making its way into the enterprise. And enterprises are realising that open source can lead to great innovation, not only for the open source platform itself, but also for the enterprises,*” says **Bob Lord.**

Following its $34 billion acquisition of Red Hat, the future of IBM is being shaped around open source.

“*There’s three principles that are really important around participating in the open source world, and we’re going to reward the champions who demonstrate this. The first is around contribution — are you contributing to the open source world at scale, meaning as you take out, are you actually giving back to the community, giving back to the community as a contributor, giving back to the community as support, it can be as simple as new code, or it could be as difficult as solving major algorithm problems, or maybe as simple as documentation, but are you contributing back? The second principle is around open governance — are you demonstrating that open governance within the community is not biased towards one company or another? Are you truly helping to solve the community’s problems, not necessarily the problem of your interest group. The third is, are you enabling the scale of the community because we firmly believe that in order to solve industry wide problems around quantum computing or AI, or access to data, we’re going to need the whole community to help us,*” he added.

At IBM India Developer Day today, the company also announced another new program, Girls of Code, and the extension of existing initiatives, Call for Code and Code and Response, for developers and the tech ecosystem in India:

**Girls of Code** — Early this week, IBM announced a collaboration with state governments across India to prepare 200,000+ girls and women in government schools over the next three years for “new collar” jobs through the exploration and study of STEM subjects in classrooms and online. A subset of this program, ‘Girls of Code’ will provide 50,000 top-performing female students a unique opportunity to participate in coding challenges and ‘Code and Response’ hackathons.

**Code and Response** — In its first year of Code and Response, IBM announced that it will pilot Project Owl, the winning solution from Call for Code 2018, in disaster-struck regions like Kerala, Puerto Rico, North Carolina and Osaka. IBM’s Code and Response is a $25 million, four-year global deployment initiative to put open source technologies developed as part of coding challenges such as Call for Code in the communities where they are needed most. Code and Response includes resources to build, fortify, test, and implement solutions at scale — including through the IBM Corporate Service Corps.

**Call for Code** — Registrations for the 2019 round of the Call for Code Global Challenge are open. Call for Code is the largest and most ambitious effort bringing start-up, academic and enterprise developers together to leverage cloud, data and AI to develop technologies that improve health and community well-being for those impacted by natural disasters.

“*When you think about the role a developer plays now in the world, it’s much deeper than it used to be. We expected developers to code before. The expectation of a developer now is to solve problems, major problems in the world, major problems in business,*” said **Bob Lord.**
