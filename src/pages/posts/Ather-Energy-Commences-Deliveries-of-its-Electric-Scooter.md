Ather Energy has commenced deliveries of its Ather 450 electric scooter. The company handed over the scooters to a few selected customers at its Whitefield factory.

Ather had opened bookings in June this year for both its models: Ather 340 and 450. According to **Tarun Mehta**, Co-founder & CEO, over 96 percent of the bookings were for the Ather 450. “*This was an experiment. We found that if you offer good value, people will opt for that,*” he said.

Ather Energy opened pre-orders in early June, 2018, and has sold out its inventory for the rest of the year. The company has completed nearly 3500 test rides at its experience centre, AtherSpace in Indiranagar, Bengaluru and has been consistently adding more charging locations to AtherGrid, its electric vehicle charging network. Electric vehicle owners can now ﬁnd 22 charging Points across the city on their AtherGrid app.

The company will soon expand its footprint in other cities, starting with Chennai. Ather has already started working on the charging network, AtherGrid in Chennai and plans to set up their experience centre, AtherSpace by Q2 2019 which will be followed by other cities.

Before delivering the electric scooters, the company set up private charging stations at each customer’s residence.

“*The past few weeks have been incredible for everyone at Ather Energy. Today, marks the real launch of the company as consumers take their ﬁrst scooters home and begin to ride them. We will continue to deliver more Ather 450s in batches to the rest of our pre-orders in the coming months. We still have a lot to learn about the ﬁnal ownership and day to day usage of our vehicles and are looking forward to the next phase of our growth*,” said **Tarun Mehta.**

“*In the coming months our focus will be on scaling everything,*” he added. The company will make investments in its supply chain, improve quality and open new experience and service centres.

The Ather 450 is designed for city riding conditions, it comes with a top speed of 80 km/hr, a range of 75 km and one of the quickest accelerations of 3.9 seconds from 0–40 km/hr in the scooter category. Also for the ﬁrst time in the category, Ather 450 comes with parking assist, which allows riders to reverse into tight parking spots. The Ather 450 has a 7” touchscreen dashboard that allows onboard navigation. The scooter’s battery pack is manufactured by the company at its Whitefield factory using over 200 cells (*18650*) in a single battery pack. It has set up a dedicated processing line for this purpose.

Ather Energy is backed by the founders of Flipkart, Tiger Global and Hero Motocorp. The company has ﬁled 43 patent applications along with 11 international patent applications and 122 design registrations of their products that have been designed and made in India.
