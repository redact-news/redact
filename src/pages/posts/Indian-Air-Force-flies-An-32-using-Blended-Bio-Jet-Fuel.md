Experimental test pilots and test engineers from the Indian Air Force’s (IAF) testing establishment ASTE (Aircraft and Systems Testing), flew India’s first military flight using blended bio-jet fuel on an An-32 transport aircraft.

The project is a combined effort of IAF, DRDO, Directorate General Aeronautical Quality Assurance (DGAQA) and CSIR-Indian Institute of Petroleum.

Indian Air Force carried out extensive engine tests on the ground. This is now followed by flight trials using 10% biojet blended ATF. This fuel is made from Jatropha oil sourced from Chattisgarh Biodiesel Development Authority (CBDA) and then processed at CSIR-IIP, Dehradun.

IAF intends to fly the An-32 transport aircraft using biojet fuel on 26 January 2019, in the Republic Day flypast.

On 27 July 2018, Air Chief Marshal BS Dhanoa, Chief of Air Staff had announced IAF’s intention to promote biojet fuels. Addressing the CII-SIDM seminar on promoting indigenised technologies, the CAS had stated that IAF intended to fly the An-32 with 10% biojet fuel on 26 Jan 2019 Republic Day flypast.

In August, Indian budget carrier SpiceJet had operated India’s first ever biojet fuel flight with a Bombardier Q400. [\*](https://medium.com/redact/spicejet-to-undertake-operations-using-atf-biojet-fuel-blend-c87ea8b6f3af)
