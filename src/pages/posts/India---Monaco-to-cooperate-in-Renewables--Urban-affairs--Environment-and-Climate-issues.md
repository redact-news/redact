Prince Albert II of Monaco, accompanied by a high level delegation, made his first official visit to New Delhi on 4–5 February 2019. Prince Albert II held talks with the President, the Prime Minister and was hosted over lunch by the President on February 5, 2019. External Affairs Minister also called on him.

During the discussions, it was agreed that there is a vast potential for establishing linkages especially in the mutually beneficial area of **infrastructure development**. It was also announced that **Diplomatic Visa Waiver** will be granted to Monaco for visiting India and the officials from both sides will be working to finalise this Agreement.

India and Monaco have shared interest in tackling climate change and use of ocean resources along with commitment for sustainable growth. The visit also demonstrated willingness of both sides to step up cooperation in the field of **renewable energy, urban affairs** (including Smart Cities) **environment** and **climate issues**.

“*India and Monaco enjoy very close and multi-faceted ties. The visit of HSH Prince Albert II of Monaco provided an opportunity for the two sides to review progress in bilateral cooperation and discuss ways to further expand the multi-faceted partnership in areas of mutual interest,*” read a communiqué from India’s Ministry of External Affairs. “*Economic and technical cooperation are important facets of our existing bilateral relations. It was agreed that India’s rapid economic growth offers an enhanced investment opportunity for companies from Monaco in various sectors. There is also scope for business cooperation.*”

The Monaco Economic Board (MEB) brought a delegation of 30+ entrepreneurs representing banking, finance, insurance, telecom, real estate, design, ITC, health & wellbeing, textile industry, logistics, maintenance, business jets and energy sectors. Public and public-private entities were also a part of the delegation (Tourism & Convention Authority, Yacht Club de Monaco). MEB members have already had a chance to learn more about prospects in India at a business conference held last October, hosted by the Third Secretary in the Economy & Commerce Wing at the Indian Embassy for France and Monaco. This is its first trade mission to India.

Suresh Prabhu, Minister of Commerce & Industry and Civil Aviation, Government of India stressed the need for India and Monaco to deepen their cooperation to develop and eventually adopt hi-end technologies to address the growing environmental concerns. Addressing the ‘India Monaco Business Forum’ organized by FICCI, in the presence of HSH Albert II, Prince of Monaco and the accompanying delegation, Prabhu said that India and Monaco can jointly work together in developing technologies to mitigate environmental concerns. He also invited Monaco industries to invest in the Indian services sector which are expected to contribute $3 trillion to India’s GDP once it is a USD 5 trillion economy in the next 5–6 years’ time.  
   
“*The government has already identified 12 champion sectors in services namely banking and finance, tourism and hospitality and healthcare services to mention a few and we want Monaco to take advantage of this,*” Minister **Prabhu** said.  
   
**Gilles Tonelli**, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation, Monaco highlighted the opportunities present in Monaco and invited the Indian companies to capitalise on the safe and sound industry-oriented policies framed by the government. He also outlined the importance of the government in societal development.  
   
**Manoj K. Bharti**, Additional Secretary, Economic Diplomacy & States, Ministry of External Affairs, Government of India said that India and Monaco had a very cordial relation since 2007 especially in trade, tourism and taxation. He further said that India’s rapid urbanisation and rising middle class is an excellent opportunity for the Monaco industries to invest in India.  
He added that there is further scope of growth and expanding the trade basket which will improve the relations between the two countries.  
   
A ‘Partnership Agreement’ was signed between FICCI and Monaco Economic Board to strengthen the institutional relations between the two countries for further increasing trade and economic relations between the two countries.

**Michel Dotta**, Chairman, Monaco Economic Board (MEB), said that for Indian companies, Monaco can act as a gateway to Francophone Africa after the signed MoU as it will not only increase the trade between the countries but also beyond.
