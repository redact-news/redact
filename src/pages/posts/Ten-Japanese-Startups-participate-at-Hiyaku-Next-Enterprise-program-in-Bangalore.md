Ten Japanese Startups are participating in the ‘Hiyaku Next Enterprise’ program being held in Bangalore. The startups were selected in November 2018 and are participating in the program from 4th to 7th February 2019. This program targets SMEs from all over Japan and provides them with necessary human networks and knowledge required for global expansion.

As a joint initiative of Japanese and Indian Government, Japan-India Start up Hub was established at Bangalore in May 2018 to serve as a platform for promoting information exchange, business collaboration and investments between the start-up ecosystems of the two nations. JETRO is facilitating the interaction of these startups with investors and the startup ecosystem in Bangalore.

Hiyaku Next Enterprise is run by Japan External Trade Organization (JETRO) and Deloitte Tohmatsu Venture Support Co., Ltd., for the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI). Through this program, the participants will learn the systems of venture companies and how to apply those to their ecosystems.

JETRO facilitated interactions between the ten startups and investors like Dream Incubator, 3one4 Capital, Axilor and Keiretsu Forum. The program in Bangalore is managed by the local JETRO office led by Takashi Suzuki, Director General, JETRO, Bangalore.

This marks an expansion of the Silicon Valley-Japan Bridge Project to Bangalore. Hiyaku Next Enterprise program is a part of ‘Silicon Valley-Japan Bridge Project’. It was announced by Prime minister Abe on April 30, 2015 during his visit to Silicon Valley. This project was intended to bridge Japanese start-up ecosystem, start-ups and entrepreneurs to those in Silicon Valley. So far the program has taken participants to Silicon Valley, New York, Austin, Singapore, Helsinki, Berlin and Israel in the previous editions. This is the first time Hiyaku Next is coming to India.

Four among the selected ten startups are part of the J-startup program : Caulis Inc., Quantum Biosystems Inc., Finc Technologies Inc. and Lequio Power Technology Corp. J-Startup is an initiative created by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) in 2018 which cultivates the brightest of Japan’s startups to succeed in the world market. Recommenders from leading business communities determine and select 92 innovative Japanese startups from over 10,000 Japanese startups to join this proram.
