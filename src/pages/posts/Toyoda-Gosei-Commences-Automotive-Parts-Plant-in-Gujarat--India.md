Toyoda Gosei, a Japanese manufacturer of rubber and plastic automotive parts, has commenced operations from its new plant at Dekavada in Gujarat, India. Toyoda Gosei Minda India’s (TGMIN) new plant will supply airbags, steering wheels, weatherstrips and other parts to Suzuki Motor Gujarat Pvt. Ltd.

Toyoda Gosei plans to increase its sales volume in India to 35 billion yen by fiscal 2025, more than twice the current level.

The company’s new plant in Dekavada, Gujarat is housed in a 18,000 sq.m. facility on 75,000 sq.m. of land. It is expected to employ 330 people by March 2021.

Toyoda Gosei Minda India Pvt. Ltd. is headquartered at Neemrana in Rajasthan, India. It was set up in 2008, with a capital of Rs. 4.4 billion as a joint venture between Toyoda Gosei Co and Uno Minda Group. The company currently employs 1,583 people.

Stricter safety regulations in India are driving the demand for airbags. India is a key market for Toyoda Gosei, and the company has been enhancing its development and production network in the country. It established a new technical and sales office (Gurugram Office) in a suburb of Delhi in April 2018.

Toyoda Gosei, headquartered in Kiyosu, Aichi Prefecture, Japan, has a network of approximately 100 plants and offices in 18 countries and regions.
