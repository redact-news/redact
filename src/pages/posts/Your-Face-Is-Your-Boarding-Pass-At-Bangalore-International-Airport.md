Bangalore International Airport Limited (BIAL) — operators of Kempegowda International Airport, Bengaluru (BLR Airport) and Vision-Box — have signed an agreement to launch paperless biometric self-boarding technology, aimed at transforming passenger experience and creating future-ready Airport.

The first implementation at BLR Airport will be completed in the first quarter of 2019, with Jet Airways, Air Asia and SpiceJet passengers as first users.

The contract was signed on Wednesday in Lisbon, Portugal, between **Hari Marar** and Vision-Box CEO **Miguel Leitmann**. The ceremony was also attended by the Portuguese Prime Minister **António Costa**, Minister of Economy **Manuel Caldeira Cabral**, Ambassador of India to Portugal **Nandini Singla**, Secretary of State of Internationalization **Eurico Brilhante Dias**, and other government representatives.

The biometric self-boarding technology is in line with the Government of India’s **DigiYatra** project, aimed at developing a digital ecosystem to provide paperless air travel.

With the implementation of the biometric technology, BLR Airport will become the first Airport in India to have an end-to-end solution for paperless air travel.

The goal of the programme is to simplify the journey by making it paperless from registration to boarding. Biometric technology will identify passengers by their face as they move across the Airport, avoiding stops and the repeated presentation of boarding passes, passports or other physical identity documents.

“*Your face is your boarding pass*,” said BIAL’s MD & CEO **Hari Marar**, describing the revolutionary technology that is set to transform air travel. “*BLR Airport will continue to lead from the front in transforming air travel in India by leveraging technology. We will continue to offer more delightful experiences to all our passengers as they travel through BLR Airport. Vision-Box’s state-of-the-art biometric technology, combined with its passenger flow platform will enable a seamless journey for our passengers, without obstacles, waiting lines or hassles, from registration to boarding,*” Marar added.

“*We’re very proud to team up with Kempegowda International Airport, Bengaluru. We’re together raising the flag of a historical milestone, marking not only the significant improvement of the experience of those who travel through Bangalore, but also the accomplishment of a seamless digital airport journey. This is the first end-to-end face recognition-based walkthrough experience in Asia and the largest in the world. It is also one of the most significant steps towards the Digital India campaign endorsed by the Government. Bangalore is in the spotlight, as the modern world gateway to India,*” said Vision-Box CEO **Miguel Leitmann.**

On the 27th of June, Vision-Box had opened an office in New Delhi, to provide biometric digital identity services within the travel industry, as well as to government and private companies. The India office is led by **Pedro Pinto**, Senior Manager, Regional Strategy and Operations for Vision-Box India

“*India is at an important turning point of its history, investing in the modernization of identity management and seamless travel programs. It is crucial for the country to have trusted partners and draw on their local teams with international expertise to support our efforts to leverage India digitization journey. Vision-Box brings in the right attitude and knowledge to partner up with India and to bring our vision to reality,*” said **Vineet J. Mehra**, Vision-Box India’s Executive Partner and Regional Advisor to the Board.

India accounts for over 17 percent of the world’s population. Airline passenger volume is estimated to grow at a robust 12 percent yearly for the foreseeable future, putting the country at 3rd world rank by 2025. This places investment in India’s citizen services and travel infrastructure at an important and crucial juncture. Private sector expertise in the delivery of seamless citizen identification technology is expected to bridge the gap between the populous demographics and exponential traveler growth, with the need for reliable, secure and efficient identity management infrastructure.
