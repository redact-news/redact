Saab will present its portfolio of products and systems (air, land and sea) at the Aero India show, which will take place in Bangalore from 20–24 February 2019.

Saab is pitching its Gripen to the Indian forces as the fighter that has the minimum flight hour cost and the maximum operational availability (while comparing it with F-16, F-18, F-35, Rafale and Eurofighter). Saab emphasises the cost efficiency with ‘true transfer of technology and a comprehensive industrial partnership.’
