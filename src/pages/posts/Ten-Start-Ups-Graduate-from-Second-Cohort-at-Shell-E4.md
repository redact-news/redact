“*Keeping in mind the idea behind introducing Shell E4, we have and shall keep identifying and engaging with start-ups who have the talent and vision to innovate technology that will further accelerate India’s transition to a sustainable energy future.*” said **James Unterreiner**, General Manager, Shell E4 Start-up Hub. “*Shell has a broad view of energy : not just oil and gas but hydrogen, solar, wind etc. We have a growth, scale and international track.*”

There are 25 start-ups in the third cohort of the E4 programme.

“*We are bringing in various focus tracks into the programme. ‘Future of mobility’ has just gone live on the website and will launch on the ground by mid October. Digital start-ups for energy is another track. In the future we will do additional focus tracks like energy efficiency*” he added.

The ten start-ups have differentiated product offerings like Battery Management, Digital — AR/VR, Mobility Solutions, Logistics, Energy Management, Operations Efficiency and Energy IOT Applications. While a number of these start-ups are working towards a pilot with Shell businesses, some others are closely working with Shell to co-create customer solutions.

With an overall approach to nurture a culture of open innovation, through various programmes like Research Connect, Shell Technology Ventures and Shell E4, Shell endeavours to support, engage and empower start-ups at various stages of their lifecycle.

Shell Ventures now has a presence in India.

Launched in 2017, Shell E4 programme aims at playing a prominent role in accelerating technologies that are fit for India’s energy transition. Shell Technology Centre Bangalore is one of the few cutting edge R&D centres in India and one of the very few in the energy space.

One of the company’s three global innovation hubs, the centre, houses the Shell E4 start-ups at a co-working space for six months. The start-ups are offered a seed funding of USD 20,000 each and access to prototyping laboratories for product development and testing, Bootcamps aimed at customer discovery and improving the product, Top industry mentors and experts, New markets and interactions with investors and other growth and funding opportunities.

Shell organised the second edition of Shell E4 Demo Day, an Energy Entrepreneurship Conference in India on July 16, 2019 in Bangalore. The event included a gathering of energy focused start-ups along with the attendance of Arvind Tiwary, Chair, IoT Forum, TiE and Subhashini Chandran, EVP and Managing Director — India at Xynteo.

“*At Shell, we constantly strive to strengthen our commitment to partner energy entrepreneurs and take steady steps towards India’s transition to a sustainable tomorrow,*” said **Sada Iyer**, Shell Technology Centre Bangalore Leader. “*We are hopeful that the next year will see even more diverse energy start-ups striving towards an advanced and sustainable ecosystem with Shell E4.*”

According to a communiqué from the company, the start-ups in the first cohort have witnessed significant growth in their businesses since their graduation last year : Detect Technologies successfully raised Series A funding of $3.3 million from Tier 1 VCs and their cofounders is featured in the Forbes 30 under 30 in both India and Asia. ION Energy’s advanced battery management & intelligence platform is being used by top tier OEMs and Battery Pack Makers in 10+ countries. IoTrek is piloting with 2 Engineering Procurement and Construction (EPC) companies at construction job sites in India and commercially launched product for US market; partnering with General Contractors to deploy the pilot projects.  
   
Startups also have the opportunity to work closely with Shell businesses themselves. For instance, Detect Technologies is working on joint R&D projects with Shell. As alumni of the programme, the startups will continue receiving access to the E4 laboratory, in addition to support from the Shell E4 team for Shell deployment opportunities.
