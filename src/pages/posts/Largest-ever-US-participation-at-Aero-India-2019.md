U.S. Navy F/A-18E Super Hornets and P-8A Poseidon aircraft joined Aero India 2019 at Yelahanka Air Force Station in Bengaluru, India, Feb. 20.

“*We are also looking forward to strengthening military-to-military relationships and showcasing the capabilities that stem from cooperative agreements with our partners in the region,*” said **Lt. Cmdr. David Shultz**, the “Golden Swordsmen” of Patrol Squadron (VP) 47 Aero India 2019 detachment officer in charge. “*Aero India offers an excellent opportunity to showcase the P-8A Poseidon to our regional partners throughout the Indo-Pacific,*”

VP-47 will join F/A-18E Super Hornets from the “Royal Maces” of Strike Fighter Squadron (VFA) 27 and 17 other U.S. military aircraft for static displays and aerial demonstrations.

“*Participating in Aero India is an amazing opportunity for our squadron to be showcased alongside our Indian allies,*” said **Cmdr. Brent Jaquith**, VFA 27’s commanding officer. “*Our squadron routinely operates throughout the Indo-Pacific and it is always a great experience to visit a partner nation’s country in person, and showcase the professional execution of the Maces and Carrier Air Wing (CVW) 5.*”

India’s MPRA squadron, India Naval Air Squadron (INAS) 312, made historic achievements this past year as they traveled across the International Date Line for the first time to join the U.S. and other allies during Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) 2018 in Hawaii.
