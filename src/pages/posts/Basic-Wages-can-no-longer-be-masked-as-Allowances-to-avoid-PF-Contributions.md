The Supreme Court of India recently ruled that special allowances that form part of wages shall be subject to provident fund contributions. On February 28, 2019, SC has delivered the judgment in the Surya Roshni Case which was on appeal since 2013.

The Court has ruled that the allowances in question were essentially a part of the basic wage camouflaged as part of an allowance so as to avoid deduction and contribution towards provident fund. The allowances failed the UNO test and there was no rational criteria for wage structure.

*‘UNO’ Test — Whether the said allowances are ‘universally, necessarily and ordinarily’ paid to all across the board. \[Manipal Academy vs RPFC (2008) relying upon Bridge & Roof vs UoI (1963)\]*

Small employers and SMEs are a worried lot, since this would mean a higher CTC (Cost To Company) per employee or a lower take-home salary, when attrition rates for skilled employees are high.

The impact of the Supreme Court ruling would be a Reduction in evasion and subterfuge, higher contribution into Social Security; and Reduction in take home pay (for some cases).

“*Usually MNCs don’t have these issues. They are very pucca (solid and permanent) in statutory compliances. They have a rational basis for special allowances,*” said **Rakesh S Sekhar**, Regional PF Commissioner — II, EPFO, Regional Office, Bangalore. According to him there is nothing new in the recent Supreme Court judgement. He was speaking at an Interactive session on the recent Supreme Court decision on Provident Fund Contributions organised by the Bangalore Chamber of Industry and Commerce (BCIC).

“*After liberalisation and globalisation the entire wage structure has changed and was structured along allowances. Most of the people given a choice would prefer a higher take home pay,*” says **K. Manickam**, Secretary General, EFSI (Employers’ Federation of Southern India). According to him the judgement is going to affect SMEs and small employers. He feels that all the six cases which have been tested in the Supreme Court were weak cases. Veteran legal practitioner **K. Kasturi** asked why Provident Fund is considered under the Finance Ministry, when it would be better placed under the Labour Ministry.

“*Henceforth while deducting employee contribution all the allowances which are uniformly paid to all the employees must be taken into account for deducting the employee contribution and also while adding employer contribution to it. Obviously, the contribution amount goes up. The employer will end up paying more money. The cost to the company goes up,*” said **Dr. V. Nagaraj** — National Law School of India University, Bangalore. According to him the judgement has only prospective effect for organisations who are not parties to the decided case. He feels that there is a scope for revision as things have changed a lot from 1952. “*Judiciary should have had the vision to foresee the mischief that could be done by the employers. Henceforth, everybody could be given a menu to choose what allowances they want,*” he said.

**Dr. Sachin** highlighted the contradiction with respect to Ignorantia juris non excusat (Latin for “ignorance of the law excuses not”), a legal principle holding that a person who is unaware of a law may not escape liability for violating that law merely because one was unaware of it. On March 7th 2019, the Supreme Court had to correct its earlier [judgement](https://www.livelaw.in/columns/payment-of-gratuity-act-teachers-per-incurium-141947) that denied Gratuity to teachers.

*Basic wages, under the PF and MP Act,1952 is defined as all emoluments which are earned by an employee while on duty or on leave or on holidays with wages in either case in accordance with the terms of the contract of employment and which are paid or payable in cash to him, but does not include: cash value of any food concessions; any DA, HRA, OT, Bonus,  
commission or any other similar allowance payable to the employee in respect of his employment or the work done in such employment; any presents made by the employer.*

*According to Section 6 of the Act: the contributions which shall be paid by the employer to the PF shall be 12% of the Basic wages, DA and retaining allowance (if any) foreach of the employees whether employed by him , for the time being payable to the employees employed by him directly or by or through a contractor and the employee contribution shall be equal to the contribution payable by the employer in respect of him.*

The CBT of EPFO has recommended increasing the interest rate on Employees’ Provident Fund for 2018–19 to 8.65% as against 8.55% in the preceding year. In order to promote start up ecosystem compliance regime based on self certification for the period of 1st 3 years has been taken up.
