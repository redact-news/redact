Samsung Opera House will showcase differentiated product experiences, built around Samsung’s philosophy of *#DiscoverTomorrowToday*. These experiences revolve around transformative technologies such as Virtual Reality (VR), Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT), which Samsung is pioneering globally.

“*Today’s consumers, especially millennials, seek unique experiences. They want to interact with the brand, touch, feel and create. This is what Samsung Opera House is about. We have curated never seen before experiences that will excite people of all age groups alike. Opera House will also organize workshops, activities and events, bringing together Samsung’s innovations with people’s passions. We are proud of the transformation that this place has seen,*” said **HC Hong**, President & CEO, Samsung SouthWest Asia.

“*The largest mobile experience centre in the world has been opened in India less than two months after Samsung inaugurated the world’s largest mobile factory in Noida in July this year,*” the company said in a statement.

Samsung will showcase its full lineup of smartphones and wearable devices at the experience centre alongside flagship consumer electronics products such as the QLED TV, Smart TVs, The Frame, and Family Hub Refrigerators. The Home Appliance zone will have a kitchen set up where a chef will provide live cooking demonstrations using Samsung smart ovens.

Samsung will have the biggest ever display of accessories, including cases, covers and power banks, on a 24-feet wall at its largest mobile experience centre in the world. Here, consumers will be offered unique customization options for accessories such as installation of military strength skins for screen protection and 360 degree body protection. They can also get laser engraving done of any design or content on the mobile covers they choose from. There will also be a range of Harman Kardon, JBL and Samsung audio products to choose from.

One will be able to enjoy VR experiences such as the 4D Sway Chair or the Whiplash Pulsar 4D chair that makes 360 degrees three-dimensional movements. One can slip into the role of a fighter pilot doing extreme aircraft stunts, or experience a space battle, or a roller coaster ride.

For those who enjoy the thrills of kayaking or rowing, a not-to-be-missed VR experience is awaiting them. Fitness enthusiasts can cycle through scenic Europe, racing alongside a friend.

Consumers can also pre-book the Centre’s home theatre zone for watching movies and shows with their families.
