First launched in 2013, the **Lexus Design Award** is an international design competition that targets up-and-coming creators from around the world. The award seeks to foster the growth of ideas that contribute to society by supporting designers and creators whose works can help to shape a better future. Six Prototype Finalists will be invited to New York to receive advice from various acknowledged professionals to develop a prototype of his/her submitted Work. LEXUS will cover the prototype production costs up to 3 million JPY.

Launched last year, the **Lexus Design Award India** (LDAI) seeks to recognize and reward the best industrial design executed by Indian designers, institutions, design consultancy firms, and in-house design teams of companies. The inaugural LDAI received over 700 entries, with 268 entries from the professional design community and 439 from students. Elephant Design Pvt. Ltd. won the Grand Prix award for the Designer/Design House of the year in 2018. Last year’s creative theme for the Lexus Design Award 2018 was “*CO-*,” a Latin prefix meaning with or together in harmony.

#### Judging criteria 2019

*   *Anticipate*: Does the concept and design anticipate not only the needs of the user experience, but the needs of society?
*   *Innovate*: Does the design demonstrate new thinking and originality in its proposal and execution?
*   *Captivate*: Is the design intriguing and compelling when realized in concept and execution?
