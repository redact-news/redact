Drone research company UAVOS Inc will present its upgraded unmanned helicopter UVH-170E at Aero India Show 2019, which will be held from February 20 to February 24 in Bangalore, India.

“*Asia is a dynamically developing market that feels an increasing need of modern, high-quality and reliable unmanned equipment to solve a wide range of tasks. We expect that a tropical version of modified unmanned helicopter with improved operational capabilities will be in great demand among our potential customers in the Asian region,*” said **Aliaksei Stratsilatau**, UAVOS Lead developer.

The upgraded UVH-170E is equipped with a gyro-stabilised two-axis gimbal with integrated 30x Optical Zoom Full HD (1080/60p) daylight camera, Thermal LWIR 1024x768 cameras, Laser rangefinder 2500 m and GPU (graphics processing unit). The optoelectronic onboard device is designed to perform complex missions and is ideally suited for a wide range of applications, including exploration, observation and cartography.

VTOL unmanned system includes UVH-170E unmanned helicopter and its GCS. The maximum take-off weight of the helicopter is 41 kg (90.3 lb), the fuselage length is 3285 mm (129.3 in). Temperature range is from -35Сº to +50Сº (-31°F to + 122°F). The unmanned helicopter has a wide speed range — from 0 km/h at the time of hovering to the highest achieved speed of 120 km/h (75 mi/h). UVH-170E is able to take off from high-altitude platforms at 2000 meters above the sea level and more, and carry a payload of 4 kg for 5 hours. The aircraft has a four-stroke gasoline engine equipped with an injector with altitude correction up to 4000 meters, a starter and a generator. The helicopter is able to fly in autorotation mode and is equipped with a ballistic parachute.

According to Aliaksei Stratsilatau, UAVOS Сhairman of the board and Lead developer, this helicopter is able to perform a wide range of tasks both in the interests of civil and law enforcement agencies: participation in anti-terrorist operations, law enforcement and intelligence operations, search and rescue, patrolling. The main advantage is that the helicopter has unique characteristics to work in high mountain conditions, in hot and tropical climates, with sudden temperature changes.
