Maruti Suzuki India Limited today launched its premium sedan Ciaz,with the new 1.5 litre K15 petrol engine. The company’s next generation smart hybrid with Lithium-ion battery makes its maiden appearance in the New Ciaz.

Suzuki, in a joint venture with Toshiba Corp. and Denso Corp., is in the process of setting up the battery manufacturing plant in Gujarat at an estimated investment of Rs 1,152 crore (Rs 11.52 billion). The company plans to launch an electric vehicle in India by 2020.

According to a report by NV Vijayakumar, officials from Suzuki and Toyota were at the Bidadi plant two weeks back, to assess its existing capability and plan further investments of over $1 billion.
