Facebook Inc has launched four initiatives to build the Artificial Intelligence (AI) ecosystem in India. At its AI for India summit, the company announced the launch of its India Innovation Accelerator, to mentor and support startups that are leveraging AI to address gaps within the high social impact areas.

“*We want to support the early stage startups in AI, so they continue to do the great work they’re doing. So we’re announcing the Facebook India Innovation Accelerator program with a focus on AI for social good. Under this program Facebook will extend mentorship and support to promising startups that are leveraging AI to address gaps in areas of social impact, including safety of women, agriculture, education, healthcare, climate change and resilience and smart cities,*” said **Ajit Mohan**, Managing Director and Vice President, Facebook India. He was speaking at the Facebook AI for India Summit which was held in Bangalore today.

Facebook also announced 100 scholarships for students and developers to enable access to advanced courses on Deep Learning to nurture ideas on utilising AI for social good. In addition to this, the company will also conduct extensive, application based AI trainings with a host of startups and developers. In order to encourage diversity within the ecosystem and support women talent in AI, Facebook plans to conduct ‘Women in AI’ hackathons.

“*We know that we’re not the only company that is doing this. But we want to make sure that we’re doing our part to connect the dots in terms of all of the work that is going on to build expertise around AI in India,*” added Ajit Mohan. “*For us, the AI for social good initiative in India is not a CSR project that we’re doing on the side. We believe that it is central to our mission of helping build communities in India.*”

“*The second thing we’re announcing is scholarships for students and developers, focused on nurturing their ideas for utilizing AI for social good. These scholarships will enable these students to gain access to advanced courses on deep learning. Third, we are going to announce AI hackathons that are aimed specifically at encouraging women developers and women-led startups that are focused on AI and the winners will be provided courses on AI and ML, by professors from IIT Madras. Under Facebook’s recently announced Facebook hubs program we’ll conduct extensive application based trainings with a host of startups across 20 locations in India,*” he said.

“*The only way India can radically transform and leapfrog ahead of the world is to use artificial intelligence and machine learning and use data. India must embrace artificial intelligence with all its might and use it for social good and that is the only way we grow at a rapid rate of 9 to 10 per cent. There’s no other way,*” said **Amitabh Kant** CEO of NITI Aayog.

“*AI is core to everything that Facebook does, All of our users who use our products, interact with some AI systems almost on a daily basis,*” says **Raghavan Srinivasan**, Director of Product, Facebook AI. “*A lot of the advances that you’re seeing in terms of product experiences today came from investments that really started four or five years ago. So over the course of the last four or five years, starting with our initial investments in computer vision, and then adding on language technologies, we have really been thinking about how do we start to invest in doing research in AI, and apply it to a large number of the product problems that we have.*”

“*For a company and a platform, the size and scale, at which Facebook operates, it is really important for us to start to think about how we automatically start to identify, detect, and eventually remove bad experiences, and bad content on the platform. And so over the course of the last few years, we started moving problems traditionally requiring a lot of human involvement to the ones that AI can now automatically detect, to eventually reduce the number of bad experiences that people have on the platform. This is a really big part of our investment and this is an area where we are really proud of the work that we’ve done so far, and will continue to keep investing in this,*” says **Raghavan Srinivasan**.
