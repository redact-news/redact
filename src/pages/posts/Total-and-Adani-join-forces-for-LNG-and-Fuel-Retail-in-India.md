Total and Adani Group have signed an agreement to jointly develop multi energy offers for the Indian energy market. This cooperation includes Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) and Fuel Retail.

The partnership has set a target of developing various regasification terminals including Dhamra LNG, on the East coast of India.

Total and Adani will create a Joint Venture to build a retail network of 1,500 service stations over the period of 10 years, on the main roads of the country, such as highways and intercity connections. These new service stations, in line with international standards, will offer Indian customers Total’s full lineup of fuels, lubricants, as well as a broad range of other products and services.

With deregulation of petrol in June 2010 and diesel in October 2014, private players have expanded their market share in fuel retailing in India.The joint venture will tap into a market growing at 4% per year driven by the development of road infrastructure and the emergence of middle class.

The share of private fuel companies in petrol retailing increased to 6.8 per cent during financial year 2017–18 from 3.5 per cent during the financial year 2015–16.
