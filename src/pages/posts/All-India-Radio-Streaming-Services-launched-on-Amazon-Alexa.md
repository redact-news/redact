All India Radio will also get an additional platform for global and domestic audiences and will cover all the shadow areas of the terrestrial broadcasting in the regional, headquarters and metro cities in particular. Alexa would supplement All India Radio’s website and App.

**A Surya Prakash**, Chairman Prasar Bharati said that the playlist of archival assets of All India Radio would also be made available on the Alexa platform in the future.

“*Voice is everywhere and already 390 million people around the world are using voice based communication and this would almost triple to 1.83 billion people in the next 3 years,*” said **Rajiv Sawhney**, Principal Tech Business Development, Amazon Alexa (Asia).

The service was launched by Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Information & Broadcasting and Sports & Youth Affairs **Col. Rajyavardhan Rathore (Retd.).**

Speaking on the occasion, Col Rathore said that Services like Amazon Alexa eased the life of a person. Launching of All India Radio’s Streaming Services on Amazon’s Alexa platform would be a synergy of Old and Modern forms of Communication. He also said that this initiative would benefit Indian diaspora around the world. Now anyone from any part of the world can listen to All India Radio programmes.
