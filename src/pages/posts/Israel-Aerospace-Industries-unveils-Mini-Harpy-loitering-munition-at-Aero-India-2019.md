“In an age of asymmetrical warfare and fast moving targets that ‘blink’ for a few seconds at a time, the use of loitering missiles provides strong capabilities for closing the circle of war. Rather than relying on precise reference point, the system we developed loiters the air waiting for the target to appear and then attacks and destroys the hostile threat within seconds. The Mini Harpy is unique in its beam detection and optical capabilities, a combination of two of our loitering missile systems that sold thousands of units in Israel and abroad,” said Boaz Levy, General Manager and Executive VP of IAI Systems, Missiles & Space Group. IAI is considered a pioneer in loitering missiles with its Harpy, Harop, Green Dragon and Rotem missiles.

The Mini Harpy combines the capabilities of the Company’s two flagship loitering missiles, the Harop and the Harpy, offering detection of broadcast radiation with electro optical capabilities. The Mini Harpy will be on displayed for the first time at Aero India Exhibition in Bangalore, India, from 20–24 February 2019 (Hall-B booth #2.1–2.2).

The Mini Harpy responds to a broad range of threats and launching scenarios: Neutralizing of radiation emitting threats such as radars and additional systems; Electro-Optical Threat detection: high quality video footage for the operator; Launching from a broad range of mobile land platforms as well as marine platforms; Multiple tools per area unit.
