Magellan Aerospace Corporation (TSX: MAL) has increased its investment in Triveni Aeronautics Pvt. Ltd. to 75 percent. Triveni is based in Tumkur, Karnataka located north west of Bangalore in India. The company specialises in hard metal machining of aero-engine and aero-structure components.

Magellan’s investment in Triveni commenced in 2013 when it acquired a 49% share of the business. Since then the company has grown, prospered and played a major role in Magellan’s overall strategy in India. The acquisition of additional shares announced today will afford Magellan the opportunity to expand and to further develop Triveni’s capabilities and business processes to support Magellan’s customers in India.

This investment comes at a time when Magellan has further increased its footprint in India with the construction of a 100,000 sq. ft. facility based in the Aerospace Special Economic Zone situated next to Bangalore International Airport. The completion of this facility, Magellan Aerospace (India), was the first of a two-phase construction that will see the plant grow to 140,000 square feet in the future.

“Magellan has been involved in India since 2005. These latest investments not only further cement Magellan’s presence in India but also demonstrate Magellan’s commitment to India which is a key element in Magellan’s global strategy” read a communiqué from the company.
