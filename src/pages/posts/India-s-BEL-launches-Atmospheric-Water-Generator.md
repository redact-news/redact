India’s state owned Defence PSU Bharat Electronics Ltd (BEL) has unveiled its Atmospheric Water Generator (AWG), which can be used to generate water straight from the humidity present in the atmosphere, at Aero India 2019.

BEL’s Atmospheric Water Generator uses heat exchange for condensing the atmospheric moisture to produce pure, safe and clean potable water. The AWG comes with a Mineralisation Unit, which is used to add minerals which are required to make the water potable. The AWG is configurable in static and mobile (vehicular) versions and is available in 30 litres/day, 100 litres/day, 500 litres/day and 1,000 litres/day capacities.

The Atmospheric Water Generator is being manufactured by BEL in collaboration with CSIR-IICT and MAITHRI, a start-up company based in Hyderabad.
