Bangalore International Airport Limited (BIAL) has signed an agreement with L3 Macdonald Humfrey to introduce a Smart Security Lane with Automated Tray Retrieval System (ATRS). This agreement comes on the back of a successful trial run in early 2017.

Work on the security hall enhancements will begin with the first automated lanes being installed in the Domestic and International check points by the end of the calendar year 2018. Replacement of existing manual lanes will be undertaken in a phased manner to ensure minimal disruption to Airport operations. The project is due for completion by March 2019.

Once fully operational, the passenger screening capacity will significantly increase by over 50%. The smart lanes with ATR will automatically return empty trays to the preparation area for passengers to place their bags and belongings, ending the hassle of looking for trays and also prevent empty trays from piling up. In addition, the automated rollers will enable the trays to automatically move into the screening machine, without the need for passengers or staff to push their trays/ bags into the X-Ray machines.

#### The Process

The Smartlanes with ATR will be complimented by the installation of Mach-Smart View Matrix System (Central Screening System) and the SEMS (Security Efficiency Management System). The Smart View Matrix system is the central screening system that allows all security screening officers to reside remotely within a secure central control room and undertake image processing in a far more efficient manner.

The Smartlanes have 4/5 parallel divest stations where multiple passengers can get ready to be screened simultaneously. Passengers who need more time to prepare can do so without hindering other passengers, who can move ahead after placing their belongings in the trays.

All trays can accommodate the maximum-allowed cabin-size baggage

Trays are RFID tagged and tracked from start to the end

Laptop and laptop bags can be kept side-by-side in the same tray facilitating a quicker repack at the other end.

At the output side, there are two lanes:

· One for security-cleared trays, which can be easily accessed by passengers for a quick repack of their belongings

· A second isolated ‘reject’ lane for baggage with any items which security staff will query.

Photo image and x-ray images of the tray are taken in order to facilitate quick physical search. Possible threat items are marked on the touch screen by a screener in a remote screening room, and the same images are available to the physical search officer to easily identify and remove items, if required. This makes the physical search process much simpler, faster, and more efficient.

“*At the Kempegowda International Airport, Bengaluru, we constantly explore ways to introduce innovation and technology to provide our passengers hassle-free and delightful travel experience. With the Smart Security Lane with Automated Tray Retrieval System, we can now process more passengers in a secure and controlled environment, improving overall operational efficiency and enhancing safety and security. In addition, passengers will benefit from a quicker passage through security checkpoints,*” said **Javed Malik**, COO, BIAL.

“*Having installed similar solutions in many European, Middle East, North American and SEA Airports, L3 Macdonald Humfrey has the expertise to implement this project at the BLR Airport, and will play a huge role in reshaping aviation security in India,*” said **Mick Macdonald**, President Macdonald Humfrey (Automation) Ltd.

“*For the first time in India, men and women will no longer need to be security screened in different locations. Families can stay together and will be screened together,*” said a statement from the airport.
