Unisys Corporation (NYSE: UIS) has announced that Bangalore International Airport limited (BIAL) — operator of Kempegowda International Airport, Bengaluru (BLR Airport) — has selected Unisys to integrate and manage all IT and non-IT systems for Phase 1 of the second terminal (T2).

Under the terms of the three-year contract, signed in the third quarter of 2019, Unisys will manage the implementation of more than 20 new IT systems procured by BIAL for Phase 1 of T2. Unisys will also undertake seamless systems integration of a complex network of IT and non-IT systems supporting the current infrastructure and the upcoming T2.

Scheduled to be operational in March 2021, BIAL’s second terminal project is designed to add capacity to efficiently process and accommodate an additional 25 million passengers per year and will be built in two phases. The BLR Airport managed 33.30 million passengers in 2018–19. It is India’s third busiest airport and among the fastest growing in the world.

“*T2 will infuse a much-needed volume, addressing growing passenger demand. It will transform the BLR Airport into a next-generation Airport with the latest technology, and boost capacity to serve customers over the next few decades. Unisys is well placed to support our vision by drawing on its expertise in the aviation industry, particularly in India, to manage this critical and complex end to end airport system integration engagement,*” said Tom Shimmin, Chief Project Officer, BIAL.

This contract strengthens Unisys’ relationship with BIAL; the two companies having partnered to provide business intelligence services including the development of an advanced data analytics platform and steering an analytics COE in 2018.

“*The Indian aviation industry is dynamic, with one of the world’s fastest growth rates, and Unisys looks forward to helping one of the nation’s key international airports digitally transform and enhance its operational scale to meet customer demand now and into the future. This agreement builds on our existing relationship with BIAL and validates our strong background as a leading systems integrator in airports within the APAC region, as well as around the globe,*” said Rick Mayhew, vice president and general manager, Unisys Asia Pacific.
