Bosch in India is boosting its beyond-mobility business with smart solutions based on growing infrastructure and consumer demand. Over the last few years, beyond mobility solutions have gained 35 percent and have contributed significantly to the company’s turnover.

“*Our business is in a process of profound transformation from a hardware focus to models that focus more on services and data. We have the capability to develop greenfield technology that can power industries in a new-age manner,*” said **Soumitra Bhattacharya**, Managing Director, Bosch Limited and President, Bosch Group, India.

Bosch’s initiatives in India are leading it into new verticals with digital solutions in the core. Fuelled by the impetus from the Indian government amid structural reforms, such as the Goods and Services Tax (GST), the country is undergoing rapid transformation as well. It is changing conventional business areas to digital by transforming businesses beyond mobility.

“*The key to success will be partnership with local players to drive connectivity forward and a localised strategy to meet consumer demand,*” said **Soumitra Bhattacharya**.
