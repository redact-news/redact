Tronx Motors, a Smartron company, has announced the launch of its smart crossover electric bike, called the “**Tronx One**”. The launch signals Smartron’s entry into the electric mobility segment after establishing itself mobile, compute and wearable device verticals.

Smartron had acquired an undisclosed equity in Chennai based **Volta motors** in February last year. It was subsequently rechristened “Tronx Motors” and the bike, Volta Zap, became Tronx One. The new bike is now coupled with the Smartron’s **tronX ecosystem**.

“*Through Tronx Motors, our vision is to extend tronX, our intelligent and connected platform to automotive industry and disrupt the commute experience that has been pretty much the same for almost a century. Commute experience of future as we see it is not only electric but also connected and autonomous. We believe Smartron and TronX Motors can uniquely differentiate its products through integration of various connected and autonomous technologies powered by tronX. For instance, we can bring voice and touch enabled intelligent services and IoT enabled lock/ unlock, location monitoring, servicing, sharing features to commuters. We can introduce a range of driver and rider assist autonomous and semi-autonomous technologies to improve travel safety, productivity and experience. We are looking to open up our motors platform to other EV companies in the future,*” said **Mahesh Lingareddy**, Founder and Chairman, Smartron.

Smartron developed and introduced tronX, an AI powered IoT platform that delivers personalised services to consumers and solutions to businesses through range of smart devices, things, vehicles and systems targeting personal, health, home, education, enterprise, infra, agriculture and energy verticals. The company is working to build a product ecosystem around tronX under its “powered by tronX” program.

Mahesh Lingareddy had sold his previous company SoftMachines for $500 million to Intel in 2013. Investors in Smartron include Indian cricketer Sachin Tendulkar and a number of global investors. Smartron was founded with a vision to build a technology OEM and IoT brand that is designed and engineered in India for the global market.
