Bangalore International Airport Limited (BIAL) and InterGlobe Aviation Ltd , which operates IndiGo Airlines have entered into a 20-year agreement to sub-lease land at the BLR Airport to build a Maintenance Repair & Overhaul (MRO) facility.

The 13,000-sq mts hangar, to be built on five acres in the BLR Airport campus, would be able to accommodate two narrow body aircraft and will have support infrastructure, including an engine QEC shop warehouse and engineering offices for all repair and maintenance.

This will be IndiGo’s second Maintenance Repair & Overhaul (MRO) facility, after Delhi. It is expected to be operational by March 2020.

“*Kempegowda International Airport, Bangalore (KIAB), with its strategic location, will play an even more important role going forward. It is for this reason that IndiGo decided to build a hangar as the core of our maintenance centre in South. This facility will become operational by 2020,*” said **Wolfgang Prock-Schauer**, Chief Operating Officer, IndiGo.

IndiGo has a fleet of over 200 aircraft, offering over 1300 daily flights and connects 52 domestic destinations and 16 international destinations. IndiGo currently operates 158 daily departures out of Bangalore, including eight international flights.

“*At BIAL, we believe that we must always offer a comprehensive bouquet of services that will facilitate the growth of our airline partners. IndiGo has been one of the fastest growing carriers at the BLR Airport. The outcome of this agreement will create more connectivity and open new markets — further enhancing its growth. We look forward to a fruitful partnership with IndiGo,*” said **Hari Marar**, MD & CEO, BIAL.

The Kempegowda International Airport, Bangalore (BLR Airport) is currently the busiest airport in South India and the third largest in the Country — having served 32.33 million passengers in 2018.

It is operated by Bangalore International Airport Limited (BIAL), where private promoters hold 74 percent (Fairfax: 54 percent and Siemens Projects Ventures: 20 percent) stake in BIAL, while the Government holds the remaining 26 percent (Karnataka State Industrial & Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited: 13 percent, Airports Authority of India: 13 percent).
