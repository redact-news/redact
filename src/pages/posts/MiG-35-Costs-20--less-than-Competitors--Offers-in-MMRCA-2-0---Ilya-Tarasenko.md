RAC MiG introduced the new MiG-35 air complex at the ongoing Aero India 2019. Ilya Tarasenko, Director General of JSC RAC MiG said that the purchase and operation of the MiG-35 fighter jet will cost the Indian Air Force up to 20% less than similar offers from direct competitors.

“*India is one of our key foreign partners. Engineers of MiG Corporation have extensive experience working with the Indian partners and they understand all the needs of the Indian Air Force clearly. We are ready to supply the MiG-35 air complex to New Delhi under exclusive conditions. These include unique technical solutions and the willingness to localise the MiG-35 production in India once the initial batch of the planes is put into service,*” said **Ilya Tarasenko**, Director General of JSC RAC MiG.

On the first day of the exhibition, India’s Defence Minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, visited the UAC stand at Aero India, accompanied by Denis Manturov, Minister of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation.

President of PJSC UAC, Yuri Slyusar took part in the CEO’s Round Table at Aero India 2019. “*Our partners have already produced more than 200 Su-30MKI aircraft in India and the existing facilities can be used to localise the production of MiG-35 aircraft. This is our serious competitive advantage,*” said **Yuri Slyusar**, President of PJSC UAC.

“*As part of the participation in the tender for the purchase of fighters by India, we believe that the MiG-35 fits India’s requirements perfectly, both in terms of its technical characteristics — the aircraft of the 4 ++ generation, and in terms of implementing India’s priority project Make in India with industrial and industrial cooperation,*” he said.

The MiG-35 has the following equipment installed: a new optronic sighting and navigation integrated system with a weapon control system, a new airborne communications complex, an advanced airborne radar with an active phased array and a digital integrated control system.

“*There is no need to disassemble the aircraft or even a part of it for maintenance and upgrading — just replacing the module is sufficient. In addition, replacement of the propulsion unit takes only 58 minutes in field conditions,*” said **Ilya Tarasenko** emphasising the high modularity of the MiG-35.

He also announced a new Public Joint Stock Company United Aircraft Corporation (PJSC UAC) after-sales service concept. Under this concept, all military and civilian equipment produced by companies belonging to the UAC will receive service support abroad in the “one window” format. This will significantly reduce the time and costs at all stages of after-sales service from the creation of technical centres to performing maintenance and repair works. It will also allow introducing a single standard for providing these services.

#### Civil Aircraft and UAVs

“*We will also present our civilian equipment like the Superjet 100. We also see great interest in the MS-21 aircraft — it is due to the fact that India’s aviation services market is one of the fastest growing in the world. In the coming years, India may become the third largest aircraft buyer in the world. Our MS-21 aircraft falls into the most sought-after niche in this market — so we see real prospects for its promotion,*” said **Yuri Slyusar**.

“*In addition, the topic of unmanned vehicles has been brought up in our talks. Now we have included it in the current agenda. We are discussing both the development of unmanned systems with subsequent production and localisation in India, and assistance and cooperation in terms of developing the necessary regulatory framework. In this sense, we have one of the most advanced systems of aviation rules. Here we have something to offer our colleagues, to exchange experience,*” he added.
