Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) has unveiled the F-21 multi-role fighter for India. Lockheed Martin and Tata Advanced Systems would produce the F-21 in India, for India.

“*The F-21 is different, inside and out,*” said **Dr. Vivek Lall**, vice president of Strategy and Business Development for Lockheed Martin Aeronautics. “*The new \[F-21\] designation highlights our commitment to delivering an advanced, scalable fighter aircraft to the Indian Air Force that also provides unrivaled industrial opportunities and accelerates closer India-US cooperation on advanced technologies.*”

“*Specifically configured for the Indian Air Force, the F-21 provides unmatched Make in India opportunities and strengthens India’s path to an advanced airpower future,*” read a communiqué from the company.

Up until now, Lockheed Martin was pitching the F16 Block 70 multirole fighter for India’s MMRCA 2.0 contract (Medium Multi-Role Combat Aircraft). Lockheed Martin and TASL announced last year that the two companies intend to join hands to produce the F-16 Block 70 in India if the aircraft is selected by the Indian Air Force. Some of its rivals in the contract diminished Lockheed Martin’s campaign by stating that they were offloading an obsolete production line to India.

“*The F-21 addresses the Indian Air Force’s unique requirements and integrates India into the world’s largest fighter aircraft ecosystem with the world’s pre-eminent defence company,*” read a communiqué from the company. “*This unprecedented Make in India opportunity combines the strength of the world’s largest defence contractor with India’s premier industrial house to deliver a historic win-win for India and the United States.*”
