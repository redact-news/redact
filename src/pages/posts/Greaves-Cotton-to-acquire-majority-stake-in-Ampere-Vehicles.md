In the first phase Greaves Cotton will acquire 67 percent of Ampere Vehicles for Rs 770 million. The Company can acquire another 13 percent at its discretion for Rs 755 million and subject to customary closing conditions.

Ampere Vehicles was founded by **Hemalatha Annamalai** in 2008 to produce battery-operated electric vehicles like electric cycles, scooters, three-wheelers and custom-built electric vehicles. The company has two production facilities in Coimbatore, with a total capacity 60,000 units per annum, and currently employs over 100 people.  Over the last three years Ampere has sold more than 20,000 electric vehicles.

The company’s electric vehicles are used for personal mobility, industrial applications and materials movement. Ampere Vehicles registered a revenue of Rs 160 million in FY 19 (April to July). It has been growing consistently from a revenue of Rs 45 million in FY 16 to Rs 71 million in FY 17 and Rs 185 million in FY 18.

**Ratan Tata** and **Kris Gopalakrishnan** are well-known investors in the company.

“*With this strategic acquisition, we will be able to address a wider range of customer segments with clean energy mobility solutions. Greaves and Ampere will be a synergistic combination of our excellence in frugal engineering & manufacturing with a new age electric mobility solutions company,*” said **Nagesh Basavanhalli**, MD & CEO, Greaves Cotton Limited.

Greaves Cotton Limited, a Rs.18 billion engineering company based in India, is currently in a transition phase. It is moving from being a traditional diesel engine manufacturer to a ‘fuel agnostic’ powertrain solutions company. The company has six manufacturing units, producing 400,000 engines annually at its plants in Pune, Aurangabad and Ranipet.

Greaves Cotton is derisking itself from automotive, which constitutes around 50 percent of its business, by building capabilities in farm equipment, generators and electric vehicle technologies. It is also increasing its presence in the B2C segment.

Greaves Cotton is also working on creating charging infrastructure solutions for electric vehicles. The company had showcased two electric powertrain solutions at the Auto Expo this year that are ready for use in three-wheelers.

Through this acquisition Greaves Cotton intends to accelerate development of clean energy technology solutions for last mile mobility and address a wider range of customer segments with clean energy mobility solutions.

“*This acquisition will accelerate the development of clean energy technology solutions for mobility needs of passengers and small businesses,*” said a statement by Greaves Cotton. Greaves will be able to leverage its distribution, aftermarket and service strengths to help Ampere grow more rapidly.
