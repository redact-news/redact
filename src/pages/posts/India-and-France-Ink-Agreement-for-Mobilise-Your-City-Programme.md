The MYC programme will support three pilot cities: Nagpur, Kochi and Ahmedabad in their efforts to reduce their Green House Gas (GHG) emissions related to urban transport by implementing urban mobility plans at local level and to help India at national level to improve their sustainable transport policy.

Mobilise Your City (MYC) is part of an international initiative which is supported by the French and the German Governments and was launched at 21st Conference of Parties (COP21) meeting in December, 2015.

The agreement was signed on 6th September by **Mukund Kumar Sinha**, OSD & Ex-Officio Joint Secretary, MoHUA and **Nicolas Fornage**, Regional Director, Agence Française de Développement (AfD). Minister of State, Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs (MoHUA) Hardeep Singh Puri and Alexander Ziegler, Ambassador of France in India were present during the signing.

The proposed assistance includes support for planning and implementation of sustainable urban transport projects, support for strengthening institutional capacity for regulating, steering and planning urban mobility, and learning and exchange formats with other cities across India for exchanges on best practices.

The details of the project activities will be worked out by AFD in consultation with MoHUA and the three partner cities including institutions such as the respective Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) for Smart Cities, the Municipal Corporations and any transport authority or transport related SPV.
