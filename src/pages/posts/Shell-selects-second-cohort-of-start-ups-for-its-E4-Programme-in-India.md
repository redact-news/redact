Shell has ramped up its E4 programme in India. From offering a single track for early stage start-ups in 2018, the E4 programme now offers five tracks in 2019, namely: 1) Growth track (early/mid stage start-ups); 2) Scale up track (mid/late stage start-ups); 3) International track (foreign start-ups entering India); 4) Women Entrepreneur track and 5) Focus track bringing together groups of start-ups in key areas such as E-Mobility, Digital, Renewable Energy, Waste to Fuel, among others.  
   
“*After a successful cohort-1 of the E4 programme, which graduated during our Shell E4 demo day last year, we are happy to announce that eight start-ups have been selected as part of the second cohort. We are scaling up by launching five tracks, to accommodate around 30 start-ups annually. Launched in 2017, the objective of the E4 programme is to play a key role in accelerating technologies that fit with India’s energy transition and the businesses operating in the country. By partnering with a diverse set of energy start-ups across the entire value chain, we aim to give back to the ecosystem by becoming the ‘partner of choice’, leading the energy transition in India,*” said **Nitin Prasad**, Chairman, Shell Companies in India.

“*Each start-up has a strong connect with Shell’s businesses and will play an integral role in fostering the development of technologies for current and emerging operations at Shell,*” read a communiqué from the company.  
   
These start-ups will be incubated at a co-working space for six months at STCB, one of Shell’s three global innovation hubs. Subsequently these startups will graduate from Shell at E4Demo Day.  
   
In February 2018, Shell had selected the first cohort of five start-ups — Detect Technologies, ION Energy, IoTrek, Trashcon and Ossus Bio-renewables. The startups, which graduated in September 2018, will continue their partnership with Shell through various collaborations.

The startups under the second cohort will undergo an acceleration program providing expert sessions, executive series, founders social, mentoring and Rs. 20,000 in funding.
