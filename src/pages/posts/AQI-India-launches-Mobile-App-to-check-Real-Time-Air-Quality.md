AQI India has launched a new Android mobile app that will enable users to check real-time values of the air quality index (AQI) and PM 2.5 at a location of their choice. Based on the data at a specific location, the app will also provide personalized health recommendations. The AQI India App is available from the Google Play Store.

The mobile app lets users view various parameters contributing to the real-time AQI values in major states and cities of the country. They can compare the data and understand these values in the time frame of 24 hours, 7 days and a month.

AQI India already has over 300 outdoor pollution monitors installed in various locations in the country. The gathered information can be streamed live on the website [www.aqi.in](http://www.aqi.in) and on AQI India’s mobile app.

“*AQI India’s vision is to provide better air quality solutions and healthy life to everyone. It is towards this that we launched a mobile app that will enable people to track pollution levels wherever they wish to travel and take adequate precautions — especially if they have elderly, children, or someone with a medical condition at home. We believe that small steps can make a huge impact and the AQI App will help us achieve this and more,*” said **Rohit Bansal**, Founder of AQI India & Purelogic Labs India Pvt Ltd.
