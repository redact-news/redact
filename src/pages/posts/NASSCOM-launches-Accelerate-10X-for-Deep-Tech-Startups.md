National Association of Software and Services Companies (NASSCOM) has unveiled Accelerate 10X, the second phase of its 10,000 Startups initiative.

The program will mentor 100 mature stage startups every year, through an immersive six-month program divided into phases of 45 days, that will focus on three key aspects — Product (Global Acceleration & Mentoring), Technology (Engineering & Deeptech Lab) and access to Patient capital.

In partnership with technology companies (such as Facebook, Google, IBM, Microsoft and Amazon Web Services), NASSCOM plans to set up Engineering & Deep Tech labs and innovation centres across India. Strategic consulting, global acceleration, leadership coaching will be provided to the startups through partners like PWC, Xinova and CEOQuest. The program will also work closely with VC/PE partners (such as Saif Partners, Inventus Capital Partners and AXILOR).

According to NASSCOM, the program will have a four-pronged approach:

*   **Orient —** Focus on diagnostic processes, requirements mapping & establishing critical success factors
*   **Execute —** Implementing the vision of startup in phases and achieve target milestones
*   **Take off —** Getting business, creating sustainable users and revenue
*   **Scale —** Creating systems, processes, business models to grow at scale

According to the association, the demand for advanced deep tech and AI-related technologies is expected to unlock a trillion-dollar opportunity in the future. AI has the potential to add US$957 billion, or 15 percent of current gross value added to India’s economy in 2035. “*Deep Tech Startups will drive this transformation as well as spearhead the broad structural transformation of the economy,*” said a statement by NASSCOM.

The AI startup sector saw an increase in funding of over 70% in 2017 with Natural Language Processing being one of the major focus areas for investors and estimates suggest that 50% of firms in India are implementing AI in their products.

*“Prowess in deep tech and artificial intelligence will be one of the main drivers of economic competitiveness in the near future and deep tech startups will drive innovation & spearhead the broad structural transformation of the economy. As the AI revolution sets in, the ecosystem needs to adapt, and more so in our role as an enabler. The Accelerate 10X program, further reaffirms 10,000 start-ups efforts in evangelizing and mentoring India’s latent, untapped talent in emerging technologies. We will continue its drive towards catalysing deep tech start-ups, build category leaders and support start-ups to create not only for India but also scale up and solve for the world,”* said **Debjani Ghosh**, President, NASSCOM.

*“Over the years while India has emerged as the third largest start-up ecosystem, our readiness to ride the next wave of deep tech and AI revolution will determine whether India will be able to unlock the trillion-dollar opportunity. policy makers and business leaders must prepare for, and work toward, the AI revolution as we are endowed with one of most vibrant markets when it comes to innovation and we have all the entrepreneurial foundation to build these deep tech start-ups and achieve quality and scale. A collaborative and coherent effort is pertinent to galvanize India’s capabilities in emerging technologies and equip our demographic prowess to power industry 4.0,”* said **Rishad Premji**, Chairman, NASSCOM.
