Netradyne, an artificial intelligence startup founded by two former Qualcomm executives, has raised $21 million in new Series B funding.

Investors in this round include Reliance Industries Limited (through its subsidiary RIIHL), who previously invested $16 million during Netradyne’s Series A round of funding, M12, Microsoft’s corporate venture arm, and Point72 Ventures. M12 led the investment round and will now hold a role on the board.

The additional investment will be utilized to expand the team that has created early success for its product, Driveri. Driveri is a vision-based driver recognition and fleet safety platform that captures and analyzes every minute of every driving experience, providing commercial fleet managers with insights into positive driving and identifying opportunities for individual coaching. The net result is reduced driving incidents, more awareness around risk and ability to reward positive driving; all of which improves driver retention.

With the Series B funding, Netradyne will be making a sizable investment in the application of AI and deep learning in new industry segments, examples include:

*   **Dynamic 3D/HD Mapping:** Provides real-time, crowd-sourced, high definition (HD) maps using commercially deployed Driveri™ devices. HD Maps enable improved transportation data analytics and autonomous vehicle research and development.
*   **Data Analytics:** Gives real-time insight into numerous aspects of driving, including road conditions, driver behaviors, unique driving scenarios, seasonal and weather-specific considerations, traffic patterns and concentrated geographic risk areas.
*   **Insurance:** Transforms analyzed data into comprehensive offerings insurance companies can use to underwrite and analyze professional drivers across the country.

“*In a very short period of time, Netradyne has made major strides in commercializing next generation AI in ways that deliver tangible impact to real businesses,*” said **Avneesh Agrawal**, Netradyne’s Founder and CEO. “*We look forward to the next chapter in Netradyne’s growth where we extend our value proposition within the commercial fleet industry, while creating new paths into emerging technology segments.*”

Founded in 2015, Netradyne has technology innovation centers in both San Diego, CA and Bangalore, India

“*Reliance is committed to fostering an ecosystem by investing ahead and in enabling intelligent connectivity solutions for the future of hyper connectivity. The follow up funding underscores our commitment to Netradyne’s engineering talent working on cutting edge technologies in the fields of AI and Machine Learning,*” said **Mathew Oommen**, President Technology, Networks at RJIL, Reliance’s digital communications and services venture.

“*We’re excited about our investment in Netradyne, an innovative company that we believe has the ability to create a safe new driving standard for commercial vehicles,*” said **Samir Kumar**, managing director at M12. “*Netradyne’s Driveri system uses deep learning and computer vision at the edge, enabling rich contextual insights that help fleets establish safe driving practices.*”

“*The customer momentum Netradyne has generated over the last year speaks volumes about their AI team and the innovative products they continue to develop,*” said **Sri Chandrasekar**, Partner at Point72 Ventures. “*We are excited to be a part of the team as they transform the driver safety industry.*”
