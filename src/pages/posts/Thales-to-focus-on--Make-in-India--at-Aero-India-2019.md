French multinational Thales plans to emphasise its locally developed capabilities at the upcoming 12th edition of Aero India, being held from 20–24 February 2019 in Bangalore. The company has been present in India since 1953. Over 600 employees are working with Thales and its joint ventures in India.

The company develops technologies for the Defence, Transport, Aerospace and Security markets. Thales will demonstrate its ‘Make in India’ plans and endeavours to support the modernisation plans of the Indian armed forces.

“*Aero India is a prestigious event providing us with an opportunity to showcase how our word-class technology and solutions help our customers achieve their big ambitions. This year, we would also take a step further and present our efforts supporting the “Make in India” initiative of the Indian government. We would have solutions being manufactured in the country through our local partners — global supply chain partners and joint ventures, among others. In addition, we will also be highlighting our hiring plans, and skilling and up-skilling endeavours through our presence at the Aero Skills Pavillion this year,*” said **Emmanuel de Roquefeuil**, VP and Country Director, Thales in India.

“*As a major player in the Indian defence and aerospace sector, Thales has been continuously supporting the Indian armed forces and the government’s flagship ‘Make in India’ programme. Thales has a rich experience in liaising with numerous local players who are part of its global supply chain. It takes pride in onboarding Indian solutions in several worldwide product lines and creating employment opportunities for hundreds of people. The solutions being developed through several Indian companies — joint venture partners, global supply chain partners — will be under the spotlight at Thales’ stand at Aero India this year,*” read a communiqué from the company.

Through a series of demonstrations, Thales will showcase its capabilities across civil and defence aerospace at its booth AB2.21. Thales will also be present at the Aero Skills Pavillion at Hall F and share various job opportunities it is creating through its footprint in the country.

Globally Thales reported sales of €15.8 billion in 2017. It has 65,000 employees in 56 countries. In India, it is headquartered in New Delhi and has other operational offices and sites spread across Gurgaon, Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Chennai and Mumbai, among others.
