Bangalore-based Morning Cart and Pune-based RainCan (Bloomskart Retail Private Limited) are currently offering Milk subscriptions, which Bigbasket plans to expand to fresh fruits & vegetables, staples, bread & eggs, pooja essentials, diapers and more. Savis Retail operates cloud connected, un-manned, smart vending machines under the name kwik24.  
   
Bigbasket has already initiated a soft launch of the new subscription service — bbdaily, in Bangalore & Pune (with 20000 subscriptions per day) and is soon to launch in 8 other metro cities. Bigbasket had raised US $300 million from Alibaba Group earlier this year and is on an expansion spree  
   
With Kwik24, Bigbasket has installed 100 smart vending machines across Bangalore and plans to further expand to other cities very soon. The vending machines are installed as part of the bb Instant service. Customers can order fresh produce like fruits and vegetables, and other FMCG products via the bb Instant app, and then pick it up from the vending machine.

“*The micro delivery startup acquisition really helps bigbasket in accelerating our need to bring fresh subscription services to our customers, daily. Be it fresh milk, fruits & vegetables or other daily needs like bread, eggs or even diapers, we want to be there fresh everyday! The Kwik24 acquisition gives us the ability to be closer to the customer by way of the bb instant smart vending kiosks where customers can almost instantly gratify their need or cravings for items like cut fruits, noodles, juices, buttermilk or flavored yogurt and what makes it interesting is that these machines are 100% unmanned and are completely operated by our customers,*” said **Hari Menon**, CEO and Co-Founder, Bigbasket.

Bigbasket was founded in December 2011 in Bangalore by a team of five — V S Sudhakar, HariMenon, Vipul Parekh, V S Ramesh and Abhinay Choudhari.
