Real estate and investment management major JLL has launched its global Centre of Expertise (‘CoE’) for Technology, Data & Information Management.

Spread over 20,000 sq.ft. at Prestige Trade Towers in Bangalore, the CoE will open with 170 (and growing) highly skilled tech experts working together to provide a single data, engineering and support platform to JLL and its clients globally.

The facility will focus on harnessing emerging technologies and developing new solutions for JLL and its clients. “*As India’s first global centre for property technology (‘PropTech’), the CoE will set new standards of innovation for the commercial real estate industry,*” read a communiqué from the firm.

The CoE is expected to drive rapid iterative innovation, aiming to set new standards for the commercial real estate industry. This includes experimenting with data and technology design, artificial intelligence, augmented reality, virtual reality and other emerging technologies to help JLL’s clients to make smarter decisions about real estate. The CoE will also collaborate with other technology partners to prototype and fast track new solutions and ideas.

“*The real estate industry is faced with a tremendous opportunity for digitisation. Technology and data will revolutionise the way we do business, and JLL wants to be at the forefront of this digital transformation. Now with a single, global technology platform and best-in-class tech talent on our side, we are one step closer to realising our ambition as the technology leader in the real estate industry,*” said **Anthony Couse**, CEO, JLL Asia Pacific.

“*PropTech is an emerging concept in India, with ample opportunity for growth. Locating our Global Centre of Expertise in Bangalore allows us to be at the heart of innovation and disruption. We are excited to usher in a new age of transformation by leveraging PropTech to help solve our clients’ problems, make smarter decisions and simplify lives,*” said **Ramesh Nair**, CEO and Country Head, JLL India.

“*Today we take a big step forward towards our digital ambitions. Our talented colleagues located in Bangalore, India will support our businesses to deliver an end-to-end digital experience, underpinned by a modern data and technology platform that will leverage JLL’s deep knowledge-base to enable unique data insights and advanced digital solutions for our clients. Aligned to our technology and data executive management team at JLL, the CoE will also serve as a liquid lab to architect, build and test advanced digital products to support our clients, as well as our firm,*” said **George Thomas**, CIO, JLL Asia Pacific.

The new workplace features an open, collaborative design, catering to the varied workflows of each employee, including focus pods, collaboration lounges and relaxation spaces. The centre also integrates smart technology such as Cave Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE) projections, allowing teams to utilise the immersive virtual reality environment for research, design or analysis. Wellness was another key consideration and the space was designed to meet the WELL Gold standard for the highest levels of health and safety in a workplace.

The inauguration of the CoE is the latest in JLL’s ongoing digital transformation, alongside strategic acquisitions, appointment of Silicon Valley leader **Vinay Goel** as Chief Digital Product Officer and launching JLL Spark, a global division dedicated to identifying and delivering new technology-driven real estate service offerings.

In India JLL recorded audited revenues of over INR 3,400 crores for FY 2017–18. The company has been present for the last 20 years in the country. JLL India has a footprint in 10 major cities (Ahmedabad, Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Pune, Chennai, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Kochi and Coimbatore) and in over 130 tier II & III locations with cumulative strength of over 10,000 staff.
