As part of the Phase-IV Su-30 MKI manufacturing under Transfer of Technology from Russia there is a shortage of some castings for manufacturing of components. Owing to this HAL has chosen Fuel system elbow as a pilot component for fabrication through additive manufacturing process.

The certification was handed over by P Jayapal, CE (CEMILAC) to Mr Arup Chatterjee, Director (Engg. and R&D) during Aero India 2019. The 3D printed fuel system elbow part is certified by CEMILAC.

Dr TR Rajanna, CD (AERDC-HAL) handed over the certified elbow part to Mr Huliraj RV, CD (AURDC-HAL) in the presence of Mr R Madhavan, CMD, HAL.
