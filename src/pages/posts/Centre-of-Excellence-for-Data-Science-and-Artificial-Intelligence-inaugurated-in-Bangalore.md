The Government of Karnataka and National Association of Software and Services Companies (NASSCOM) have launched the Centre of Excellence for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (**CoE — DSAI**), in Bangalore. NASSCOM also signed an MoU with Niti Aayog to collaboratively foster applied research, accelerating adoption and ethics, privacy and security.

The Centre of Excellence for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence will create a platform where stakeholders ranging from industry to academia can co-create digital solutions for Industry 4.0. NASSCOM will work with the industry and government to identify use cases for technology intervention, enable industry-oriented research, augment citizen-centric solutions, promote data-driven decision making, enhance academic capacities, and support appropriate skills building and talent development through the CoE.

The CoE-DSAI will support small and medium businesses, by fast tracking their product development, providing market access to enterprises and assisting them by co-creating programs along with other industry partners and start-ups to solve complex and real world business problems.

It will also work with Government & Enterprises to make available large data-sets for training models, creating a technology platform (Cloud + On Premise) with requisite library of solutions and bringing experts with deep knowledge of the business to provide mentorship along with sharing of best-practices. The centre will also partner with universities to develop and provide access to right skill & talent alongside showcasing these emerging businesses across various NASSCOM platforms.

NASSCOM has partnered with **Intel** and **IBM** as its founding members and technology advisors for augmenting and accelerating the Data Science & Artificial Intelligence ecosystem in the country.

“*Our collaboration with the Government of Karnataka, NASSCOM, and the industry to set up the CoE aims to enable developers, researchers, and solutions providers in India to create relevant use cases and applications. These technologies will drive the data revolution of tomorrow, and we are focused on fostering a thriving ecosystem in India that can also serve the global market,*” said **Nivruti Rai**, country head of Intel India and vice president of the Data Center Group, Intel Corporation.  
   
“*Artificial Intelligence, the vital driver for business transformation is an incremental journey. It is when right data and information architecture come together along with Machine Learning capabilities that game-changing insights are generated and further leveraged by organizations to deliver exponential outcomes. Start-ups, enterprise clients and university students can leverage the COE to co-create, co-innovate, and scale their ideas and skills using Data Science and Artificial Intelligence technology on IBM Cloud Platform*,” said **Gaurav Sharma**, Vice President, IBM India Software Labs & IBM India/South Asia Growth.
