For the first batch of the training programme, 30 participants from 17 countries were selected (Algeria, Argentina, Azerbaijan, Bhutan, Brazil, Chile, Egypt, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Mexico, Mongolia, Morocco, Myanmar, Oman, Panama and Portugal). They will be imparted two months training. These participants were selected from 87 applications from 34 countries.

UNNATI programme is planned to be conducted for 3 years by U.R. Rao Satellite Centre of ISRO in 3 batches and will target to benefit officials of 45 countries.

UNNATI, a capacity building programme on Nanosatellite development, is an initiative by ISRO to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the first United Nations conference on the exploration and peaceful uses of outer space (UNISPACE-50).

The programme aims at capacity building in satellite technology for the participating countries by providing hands-on experience in building and testing of nano-satellites. The course is intended to offer a simplified and increased exposure to satellite fabrication technologies. The course material has been compiled in books and CDs which were launched today.

In June 2018 ISRO chairman K Sivan had announced the programme during the UNISPACE+ 50 in Vienna, which celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of the first United Nations Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space.

Dr. K. Sivan, Chairman, ISRO briefed about various activities undertaken by ISRO. Other Senior officers and dignitaries were also present.

“*If you look at the Earth from 100km away, you will find no boundaries. Space can bind humanity and UNNATI will do that. Participating countries will be able to use what they learn here to improve their countries*,” said ISRO chairman **K Sivan**.

“*Space Technology has been provided with more budgetary allocations during the last five years and now it is utilised in Infrastructure Developments like roads, Railway lines and most importantly in disaster management,*” said Union Minister of State for Atomic Energy and Space Development of North Eastern Region (I/C), Prime Minister’s Office, Personnel, Public Grievances &Pensions, **Dr. Jitendra Singh**. He was addressing the gathering after inaugurating the UNNATI- (Unispace Nanosatellite Assembly & Training) programme organized by ISRO in Bengaluru today.
