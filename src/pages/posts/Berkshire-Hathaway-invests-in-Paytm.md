Indian digital financial services firm, Paytm, today announced that Warren Buffet owned Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRKB), a Corporation headquartered in Omaha, Nebraska, United States, has invested an undisclosed amount in the company.

This is Warren Buffet’s first investment in an Indian company. The investment is also an aberration to Buffet’s usual disinclination to invest in internet firms. Berkshire Hathaway is reported to have picked up a 3–4 percent stake in One97 Communications Limited, that owns the brand Paytm, for more than Rs 25 billion.
