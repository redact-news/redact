The Government of India has set up a National Mission on Transformative Mobility and Battery Storage, to drive clean, connected, shared, sustainable and holistic mobility initiatives. This was approved yesterday by the Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

The Union Cabinet also approved a Phased Manufacturing Programme (PMP) valid for 5 years till 2024 to support setting up of a few large-scale, export-competitive integrated batteries and cell-manufacturing Giga plants in India. In addition to this a PMP valid for 5 years till 2024 to localise production across the entire Electric Vehicles value chain was also approved. Both PMP schemes will be finalised by the National Mission on Transformative Mobility and Battery Storage.

A phased roadmap to implement battery manufacturing at Giga-scale will be considered with initial focus on large-scale module and pack assembly plants by 2019–20, followed by integrated cell manufacturing by 2021–22. Details of the PMP for Batteries shall be formulated by the Mission.

The “National Mission on Transformative Mobility and Battery Storage” with an Inter-Ministerial Steering Committee will be chaired by CEO NITI Aayog. The Steering Committee will be comprised of Secretaries from Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, Ministry of Power, Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, Department of Science and Technology, Department of Heavy Industry, Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade, and Director General, Bureau of Industrial Standards.

The Mission will recommend and drive the strategies for transformative mobility and Phased Manufacturing Programmes for EVs, EV Components and Batteries. A PMP will be launched to localise production across the entire EV value chain. The details of the value addition that can be achieved with each phase of localisation will be finalised by the Mission with a clear Make in India strategy for the electric vehicle components as well as battery. The Mission will coordinate with key stakeholders in Ministries/ Departments and the states to integrate various initiatives to transform mobility in India.

During the Global Mobility Summit held in September 2018, the Prime Minister had outlined the vision for the future of mobility in India based on 7 C’s : Common, Connected, Convenient, Congestion-free, Charged, Clean and Cutting-edge mobility.

The dedicated multi-disciplinary mission is intended to facilitate cooperative federalism, extensive stakeholder and inter-ministerial consultations and implement end-to-end policy framework for transforming the mobility landscape with particular focus on: Manufacturing, Specification & standards, Fiscal incentives, Overall demand creation and projections, Regulatory framework and Research & Development.

These mobility solutions are expected to bring in significant benefits to the industry, economy and country. In addition to improving air quality in cities it is expected to reduce India’s oil import dependence and enhance the uptake of renewable energy and storage solutions. The Mission will lay down the strategy and roadmap which will enable India to leverage upon its size and scale to develop a competitive domestic manufacturing ecosystem for electric mobility.

“*Affordable, accessible, inclusive and safe mobility solutions are primary strategic levers for rapid economic development and improving ‘Ease of Living’. Shared, connected and clean mobility solutions are increasingly becoming the key principles of effective mobility solutions across the world. Given its commitment to climate goals, India needs to adopt effective strategies to place itself as a key driver of the mobility revolution in the world,*” read a communiqué from the Government.

This initiative will define the roadmap for transformative mobility in “New India” by introducing a sustainable mobility ecosystem and fostering Make-in-India to boost domestic manufacturing and employment generation in the country. It will prepare the necessary roadmap that will enable India to leverage upon its size and scale to produce innovative, competitive multi-modal mobility solutions that can be deployed globally in diverse contexts.
