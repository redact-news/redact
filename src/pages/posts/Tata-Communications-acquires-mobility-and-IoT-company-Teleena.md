Tata Communications is acquiring Teleena, a Netherlands-based Internet of Things (IoT) connectivity specialist and mobile virtual network enabler (MVNE). The company’s technology reduces the operational complexity and cost of mobility and IoT deployments for businesses.

This acquisition follows Tata Communications’ investment in Teleena in January 2017, when the company became the single largest shareholder in Teleena with a 35% stake.

The acquisition gives the company full access to Teleena’s technology portfolio, including its MVNE platform, its Operational Support System / Business Support System (OSS/BSS) solution, and the expertise of Teleena’s mobility and IoT industry specialists.

“*I’m excited about this next stage on our 10-year journey, because just like Teleena, Tata Communications is fast-moving, ambitious and focused on innovation,*” said **Kim Bybjerg**, CEO of Teleena. “*I look forward to working with Anthony and his team to help Tata Communications’ customers make the most of the transformational potential of IoT and mobility, and support the company’s mission to become one of the leading players in this industry.*”

“*The growth rate in the global mobility and IoT market is phenomenal: by 2021, enterprises’ spending on mobility alone is set to surpass USD 1.7 trillion,*” said **Anthony Bartolo**, Chief Product Officer, Tata Communications. “*Our vision is to create an environment where anything can be ‘born connected’. Providing everyone and everything in the world with seamless connectivity globally will support businesses’ digital transformation. The combination of the Tata Communications MOVE platform, and Teleena’s technology and talent, will help us fulfil this vision, and accelerate our growth in the mobility and IoT market.*”

Since its launch in February 2017, the Tata Communications MOVE platform has been adopted by businesses to introduce mobile and IoT services. These businesses include children’s smartwatch makers *Omateand Doki Technologies*, new mobile network virtual operators (MVNO) like Singapore-based *MyRepublic*, and the smart logistics company *W-Locate*.

Teleena’s solution is a key part of the Tata Communications’ MOVE platform, which enables enterprises and device manufacturers to capture, move and manage information worldwide through borderless, secure and scalable connectivity. The acquisition is an investment in technology and talent to complement Tata Communications’ growth strategy in the global mobility and IoT market.

Teleena’s customers will now transition to become Tata Communications’ customers, and all Teleena employees will become Tata Communications’ employees.
