India’s Defence Ministry has signed a contract with Goa Shipyard Ltd (GSL) for construction of two additional Project 1135.6 Follow-on ships in India, at Goa Shipyard Limited (GSL).

Designed by Severnoye Design Bureau, the first batch of ships were built by Baltic Shipyard (*Baltiysky Zavod*) and the second batch by Yantar Shipyard in Kaliningrad.

An Inter-Governmental Agreement (IGA) between the Government of Republic of India and Government of Russian Federation was concluded on 15 Oct 2016, for construction of additional Project 1135.6 Follow-on ships in India, at GSL. In line with the IGA, the Government signed a contract for construction of two ships with GSL with scheduled delivery in June 2026 and December 2026 respectively.

The *Talwar*\-class frigates or Project 11356 are a class of guided missile frigates designed and built by Russia for the Indian Navy. The Talwar-class guided missile frigates are the improved versions of the Krivak III-class (Project 1135) frigates used by the Russian Coast Guard.

The Severnoye Design Bureau developed the Project 1135.6 vessel using an earlier Project 1135.1 design, which dated back to the early 1980s.

The ships feature the Zorya designed and Mashproekt (Ukraine) manufactured M7N.1E gas turbine plant which comprises two DS-71 cruise turbines and two DT-59 boost turbines in two engine rooms. The cruising component consists of two DS-71 gas-turbine engines, each rated at 9,000 horsepower (6,700 kW) in forward running, and 1,500 hp (1,100 kW) in reverse.

The follow-on P 1135.6 series of frigates, customised to meet the Indian Navy’s specific requirements, are platforms, with a mission span covering the entire spectrum of Naval warfare: Air, Surface and Sub-surface. The ships would be equipped to operate in littoral and blue waters; both as a single unit and as consorts of a naval task force. Advanced features of stealth include a special hull design, to limit radar cross-section, low electromagnetic, infrared and under water noise signatures. The ships would carry highly sophisticated weapon systems and sensors. To support these ships through their life cycle, the Indian Navy has put in place requisite infrastructure for training and maintenance.

In line with the Government’s ‘Make in India’ initiative, these ships being constructed at GSL, Goa under Russian assistance, would make these platforms the largest number of ships of a class in service showcasing indigenous equipment such as sonar system, Brahmos missile system, Combat Management System etc. When the project began, nearly two decades back, it involved around 130 suppliers from Russia, India, Britain, Germany, Denmark, Belarus, Ukraine and other countries including over 30 St. Petersburg-based naval design organisations and institutes.
