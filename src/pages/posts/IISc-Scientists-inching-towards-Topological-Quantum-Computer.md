The work published in the current issue of the journal ACS Nano reports the first sighting of a 2D Majorana Fermion mode. For this the authors looked at junctions between two exotic materials: a 2D superconductor and a 3D topological insulator and combined them by creating a perfectly pristine interface. At this interface, at low temperatures, the authors could detect interesting electrical transport signatures that were a spot-on match with characteristic signatures of 2D Majorana fermions. Although theoretical proposals for the observation of Majoranas in such device geometries date back to 2008, materials available back then were simply not clean enough to support such an observation. Development of newer quantum materials were necessary.  
   
PhD student Abhishek Banerjee and undergraduate student Ananthesh Sundaresh performed the experiments under the mentorship of their supervisors Prof. P. S Anil Kumar and Dr. Rajamanickam Ganesan. The team had to wade through critical material science challenges over the course of half a decade before they could perfect their topological insulators to the extent that it could support exotic topological surface states that combine with superconductivity to form the Majorana. However, not just any superconductor would combine nicely with their topological insulator. Special two-dimensional superconductors discovered only a couple of years back would turn out to be the necessary ingredient, which when combined with the topological insulator in a highly inert environment through a process known as van der Waals epitaxy, gave rise to the exotic topological superconductor that authors hoped to access.

The sighting of the 2D Majorana is a breakthrough in itself, but it is yet to be understood how these Majoranas could be used for applications such as quantum computing. The team has made advances in these directions as well, with their ongoing work focused on the manipulation of Majorana fermions in gate-defined geometries with the eventual aim of realising a working topological quantum computer.

Majorana Fermions are exotic particles that behave as their own anti-particles. This was hypothesised by Ettore Majorana in 1937. With zero charge, zero spin and zero energy, such particles interact very little with environmental degrees of freedom and can virtually hide in plain sight in solid-state systems, with their quantum mechanical states protected from noise and disorder. Evidently, topologically protected quantum mechanical states are heavily sought after as building blocks for storing and manipulating quantum information. Groundbreaking experiments in 2012 showed the existence of the elusive Majorana in semiconducting nano-wires coated with a superconductor. However, these experiments could only demonstrate the Majorana fermion in zero dimension. On the other hand, it was known for a long time that Majorana fermions could exist even in higher dimensions, as states living on the boundaries of exotic superconductors. Experimental demonstration of a higher dimensional Majorana was however lacking, until now.  
   
Prof. P. S. Anil Kumar pointed that tireless effort put in by Abhishek Banerjee, supported by Ananthesh was the key ingredient for this success along with the timely funding from Nano mission of Department of Science and Technology, Govt. of India.
