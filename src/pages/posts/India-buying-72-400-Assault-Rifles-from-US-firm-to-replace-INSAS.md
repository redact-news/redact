The deal costs around Rs 700 crore.

The Indian Armed Forces are presently equipped with 5.56x45mm INSAS Rifle (INdian Small Arms System). “There is an urgent requirement of replacing the in service 5.56x45 mm INSAS rifle with a 7.62x51mm assault rifle which is compact, robust, modern in technology and simple to maintain in field conditions,” read a communiqué from the government.

INSAS is a family of infantry arms consisting of an assault rifle and a light machine gun. It is manufactured by the Ordnance Factories Board at Ordnance Factory Tiruchirappalli, Small Arms Factory Kanpur and Ishapore Arsenal. The INSAS assault rifle has been the standard infantry weapon of the Indian Armed Forces.

According to SIG Sauer, one-third of US police use SIG firearms. The 7.62×51mm NATO (official NATO nomenclature 7.62 NATO) is a rimless bottlenecked rifle cartridge developed in the 1950s as a standard for small arms among NATO countries.
