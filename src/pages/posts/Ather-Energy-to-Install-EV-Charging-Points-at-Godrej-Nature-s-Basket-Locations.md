Ather Energy has announced a strategic association with Godrej Nature’s Basket to expand AtherGrid, the company’s EV fast-charging public network’s presence in India. As Ather expands its presence across India, the 35 locations that Godrej Nature’s Basket operates across the country will host AtherGrid Points. Ather Energy currently operates in Bangalore and will be entering the Chennai market later this year, followed by other major cities across the country.

Ather signed an MoU with Godrej Nature’s Basket for a pan-India association that will see the company set-up its charging points at various outlets of the grocery and fresh-food store, the first of which is up and running at the Sadashivnagar outlet in Bangalore.

“*For us, partnering with a brand like Godrej Nature’s Basket was a natural choice for AtherGrid. Their wide network and ease of accessibility allows us to offer charging at locations that fit seamlessly into our consumers’ lives. We are excited about bringing newer locations for Bangalore residents to charge their electric vehicles at and take the first step towards a pan-India expansion,*” said **Ravneet Phokela**, Chief Business Officer, Ather Energy.

Ather has also announced its expansion plans for Chennai which will be rolled-out with the establishment of AtherGrid ahead of the commercial launch of the vehicles. Ather will also be setting up 10–15 charging points before the commercial launch of the scooters in the city and are actively seeking partnership with progressive minded institutions in Chennai.

The electric two-wheeler company which began delivery of Ather 450 in September 2018, has its charging infrastructure, AtherGrid, currently at 24 locations with 31 charging points operational in Bangalore. The fast charging network is accessible, free of cost, for all electric vehicles in the city until September 2019.
