“*Boeing has been closely supporting the modernization and mission-readiness of the Indian armed forces with advanced products and services, and we look forward to continued discussions on their future requirements,*” said **Michael Koch**, vice president, Boeing Defense, Space & Security in India. “*Boeing’s advanced capabilities for India include the Make in India F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter, KC-46 aerial refuelling tanker, AH-64E Apache attack helicopter, P-8 long-range maritime surveillance, and services.*”

During the show, Boeing will focus on the partnerships with its defense and commercial customers, and highlight strategic investments in developing India’s aerospace ecosystem, with the theme ‘The Future is Built Here.’

“*We are proud of our long history and partnership with India and to be a part of its growing aerospace industry,*” said **Dinesh Keskar**, senior vice president, Asia Pacific and India Sales, Boeing Commercial Airplanes. “*The Indian economy is projected to grow by nearly 350 percent over the next two decades to become the third largest economy in the world, which will fuel the continuous growth of India’s commercial aviation market — resulting in the need for 2,300 new airplanes for India.
