Sojitz plans to open an office in Bangalore, India by April 2019 to partner with start-ups and create new businesses geared towards Indian and overseas markets. Sojitz Corporation is a *sogo shosha* (general trading company) based in Tokyo, Japan that also invests in various sectors and conducts financing activities. Sojitz plans to use information from Continuum I to enter unexplored business areas as well.

3one4 Capital is run by **Pranav Pai** and **Siddarth Pai**, sons of Mohandas Pai, former CFO and Board Member at Infosys.

“*This is the first successful case ever since the Ministry of Economy along with JETRO started the Indo-Japan Start-up Hub last May in Bangalore. Sojitsu, one of the major trading companies in Japan, has now invested in Bangalore exclusively for the purpose of start-up initiatives. This trend will accelerate other Japanese investors to invest in Bangalore. This will further be facilitated by the new direct flight from Tokyo to Bangalore that has been announced recently. The business set-up is now ready to take-off. Even though Japan has been a late comer, we are now catching up fast,*” said **Takayuki Kitagawa**, Consul-General of Japan in Bangalore.

“*Through this investment in 3one4’s venture fund, Sojitz aims to obtain a broad range of information on market trends and promising start-ups with innovative AI and IoT technologies. Sojitz hopes to use this information to create new business in some of the industries in which it is already involved, using Sojitz’s wide-ranging network and broad knowledge base,*” read a communiqué issued by Sojitz Corporation.

Bangalore is a hub for start-ups, with a high population of IT professionals and the many companies with global strategy offices and research development centres based in the city. Sojitz is expected to partner with some of these start-ups to create new business geared towards the Indian and overseas markets.
