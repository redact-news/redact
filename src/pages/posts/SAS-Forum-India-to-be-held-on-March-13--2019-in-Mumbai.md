Analytics software provider SAS will be hosting its annual analytics forum — SAS Forum India — on Wednesday, March 13, 2019 at Renaissance Convention Centre, in Mumbai.

“*AI is slowly but steadily transforming the way we function today not only as businesses but also in our personal lives. To keep pace with the change, requires executives to make nimble, informed decisions about where and how to employ AI in their business. At the SAS Forum India this year, we are excited that we have been able to secure an outstanding line-up of industry experts who have walked the talk,*” said **Noshin Kagalwalla**, Vice President & Managing Director, SAS Institute India Pvt. Ltd.   
   
“*Data is now on the forefront in enabling organizations to tackle some of the most crucial issues of the world.
