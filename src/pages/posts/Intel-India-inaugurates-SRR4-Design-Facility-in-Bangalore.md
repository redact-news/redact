The SRR4 is the second building in India to be constructed with the ‘**One Storey High Technology**,’ with each floor being built on the ground, then lifted and attached to the top of the building. SRR3 at Intel India’s Bengaluru campus on Sarjapur Ring Road was the first building in India to be built using Top Down construction technology. “*This technology resulted in the reduction of scheduled construction time by up to 60% compared to traditional methods,*” read a communiqué by the company.   
   
The new building is equipped with IoT-based smart features, including smart lights and real-time occupancy management, as well as innovative energy harvesting tiles installed at the entrance of the building that generate and store energy as people walk into the building. In addition, it uses renewable energy sources like solar and fuel cells for power generation, which is expected to meet 40% of the building’s power demand and reduce CO2 emissions by 37%.  
   
The design facility was inaugurated by **Manoj Sinha**, Minister of State (IC) for Communications and Minister of State for Railways, Government of India, and **Bob Swan**, CFO and interim CEO of Intel Corporation in the presence of many other delegates from the government, industry and academia.

**Intel Technology Awards in honour of the late Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam**

In an effort to accelerate innovation and research, Intel India in collaboration with the Government of India is instituting national-level awards named in honour of former President of India and eminent scientist, the late Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam. These annual awards have been introduced with the intent to recognise and celebrate the pioneering work and contributions made by distinguished scientists and innovators across three categories: *Product Innovation Award, Technology Advancement Award and Research Award*

The first recipients of these awards will be honoured for work that has created significant impact to society, businesses, environment and livelihood over the last 20 years. The awards are part of Intel India’s ongoing efforts to inspire Indians to actively pursue technology and research, making India a hub for technology advancement, research and innovation.  
   
**Framework for WISE initiative to promote inclusive participation of women in the industry**  
Intel India is part of Women Innovators, Social Leaders and Entrepreneurs (WISE), a collaborative initiative with key women leaders who offer leadership, mentoring, and development opportunities for women entrepreneurs and innovators in an effort to increase women’s participation in growing India’s economy.  
   
As part of the initiative, Intel India has developed the WISE-Readiness (WISE-R) framework that enterprises can use to accelerate inclusive participation of women in the industry. With a goal to have 500 enterprises WISE-Ready over the next 5 years, the framework includes key parameters like gender diversity representation and retention in the organisation, number of women who have rejoined work after a career break, benefits for women in the workplace that promote work-life balance, number of women-led businesses in the supply chain, women-led startups being supported by them, and number of girls/women trained in STEM by enterprises.
