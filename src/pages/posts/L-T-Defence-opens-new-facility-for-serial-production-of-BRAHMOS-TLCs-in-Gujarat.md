**L&T Defence**, the defence arm of engineering, technology and construction major Larsen & Toubro (L&T), has opened a new production line at its **Advanced Composites Manufacturing Facility** in Ranoli, **Vadodara** to manufacture Transport Launch Canisters (TLC) for the **BrahMos** supersonic cruise missile system.

L&T Defence is also augmenting the infrastructure at its Precision Manufacturing & Systems Complex, **Coimbatore** by adding a Composites Facility which will cater to serial production requirements of the cruise missile system.

The canister for the missile serves the dual role of a container and launching tube. They are are designed for storage, transportation and launch of the supersonic cruise missile.

The BRAHMOS missile has been integrated with L&T-manufactured Composite Airframes and two different versions of Transport Launch Canister (TLC). L&T Defence has successfully completed the realisation of Composite Airframes for the tactical missile.

L&T Defence has also been closely involved in the design, development and production of Launchers and Fire Control Systems (FCS) for BRAHMOS missiles on naval platforms.

**Dr. Sudhir K Mishra**, DS & Director General (BrahMos) and CEO & MD, BrahMos Aerospace, inaugurated the production line.

“*We have been associated with the development of BRAHMOS missile programme for close to two decades. Our journey started under the guidance of DRDO to develop indigenous capabilities and facilities for realization of composite airframes, canisters and allied sub-systems for BRAHMOS missile. Our products have successfully passed applicable qualification tests, and L&T has already started delivering these articles under serial production mode,*” said **Jayant Patil**, Senior Executive Vice President for L&T’s Defence Business.

L&T Defence’s Advanced Composites Manufacturing Facility at Ranoli, Vadodara, is NADCAP (*National Aerospace and Defence Contractors Accreditation Program*) accredited for manufacturing of Aerospace Products. The facility has also received an accreditation certification from the National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL).

Speaking on the occasion, **Dr. Sudhir K Mishra** said, “*The highly successful BRAHMOS missile programme has taken a remarkable lead under the flagship ‘Make In India’ initiative of our Government. Today, BrahMos has created a robust ecosystem of indigenous defence manufacturing and integration, thus reinforcing and realising the long-cherished dream of self-reliance in this critical sector. And the immense contribution of each of our defence industry partners in this direction is highly commendable.*”
