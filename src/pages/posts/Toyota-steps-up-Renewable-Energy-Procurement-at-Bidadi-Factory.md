Toyota Kirloskar Motor (TKM) sourced 87% of electricity from renewable source of energy for its operations in Bidadi facility till January 2019 (in FY 2018–19).

TKM has gradually increased Green Energy Procurement and Investment in renewable energy sector to meet its energy requirements. The company has installed in-house solar power plants at roof tops and ground in its facility at Bidadi, which has a combined capacity of 8.4 MW of electricity.

Toyota Kirloskar Motor has explored various possible avenues to increase its renewable energy share including inhouse solar parks, outside solar parks, open access sourcing etc. The renewable energy sourcing has increased from 15% in FY 15–16 to 65% in FY 17–18.

“*Business can play a significant leadership role in accelerating the transition to a lower-carbon economy, we see renewable energy to be a key component of climate action efforts. As a responsible corporate citizen, we at Toyota strongly believe in the philosophy of “Respect for the Planet”. Reiterating our commitment to enable greener environment, TKM sources clean energy and adopts smart manufacturing systems towards Toyota’s ultimate global mission of Zero Carbon Emission,*” said **Masakazu Yoshimura**, Managing Director — Toyota Kirloskar Motor.

“*I am very proud to declare that during October 2018, we achieved 100% renewable power source for our energy requirements. Through such significant goals, TKM could effectively contribute towards emission reduction by over 51,000 tons of Co2 during first three quarters of FY 2018–19,*” he added.

TKM has also devised strategies to reduce the Co2 emissions at its manufacturing facilities through energy “Consumption Reduction” and “Conversion Efficiency”. Under Conversion Efficiency enhancement approach, TKM aims to improve the operational efficiency by transforming energy from one form to another form through continuous improvements which has been contributing effectively towards maximization of green energy adoption at TKM’s manufacturing plant.
