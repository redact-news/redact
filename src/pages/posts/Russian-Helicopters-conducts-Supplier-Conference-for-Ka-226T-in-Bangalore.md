Russian Helicopters Holding Company (a part of Rostec State Corporation) organized a supplier conference of potential suppliers of components for Ka-226T helicopter made in India. The event took place within the scope of Aero India Show 2019 with more than 30 Indian industrial enterprises as participants. Identifying the chain of local suppliers is a part of the project of setting up the production of Ka-226T helicopter in India.

The day before, Russian Helicopters signed the Memorandums of understanding with Elcom, Valdel Advanced Technologies, Dynamatic Technologies, Integrated Helicopter Services and Bharat Forge. They are willing to supply blades, radiostations, landing gear and the elements of fuselage.

“*We are facing an ambitious task because the world has so far not seen such projects of transferring leading-edge rotorcraft production. To set up the production of Ka-226T helicopter, its assemblies and components, is not possible without the reliable Indian partners and future suppliers having a sufficient number of technological competences and work experience in the aviation sphere. The objective of current interaction between Russian and Indian industrial enterprises is to present the background information on the project, a joint discussion of technical issues and finding further ways of cooperation,*” stated **Andrey Boginskiy**, Director General of JSC “Russian Helicopters”.

Light utility helicopter Ka-226T features coaxial main rotor system, maximum take-off weight of 3.6 tons and is capable of transporting up to 1 ton of payload. The main distinctive feature of the helicopter is its modular design. Ka-226T can be easily fitted with a transport cabin enabling the transportation of up to 6 people, or with modules carrying special equipment. Flight performance of Ka-226T helicopter, its environmental friendliness, cost effectiveness, state-of-the-art avionics suite and additional flight safety solutions make this helicopter one of the best in its class.

In 2015, Russia and India signed an agreement on cooperation in the sphere of helicopter manufacturing. According to the agreement the Indian Armed Forces will take delivery of 200 Ka-226T; at least 140 out of that number are to be produced in the territory of India under the program “Make in India”. In May 2017, Russian Helicopters, Rosoboronexport and Hindustan Aeronautics Limited founded a joint venture that deals with localization issues.
