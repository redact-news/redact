Today at VMworld 2018 Europe, VMware, Inc. (NYSE: VMW) announced that it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire Heptio, a company co-founded in 2016 by Joe Beda and Craig McLuckie, two of the creators of Kubernetes. With this acquisition VMware intends to accelerate enterprise adoption of Kubernetes on-premises and across multi-cloud environments.

Heptio has a set of products, open source projects and contributions to upstream Kubernetes. The company also works with organizations through training, support and professional services that speed integration of Kubernetes and related technologies into the fabric of enterprise IT. As a result, Heptio will be able to open new channels for VMware to further engage the open source community and harden upstream Kubernetes as well as support the cloud native needs of the largest enterprises in the world upon closing.

VMware and Pivotal have delivered PKS, a comprehensive Kubernetes portfolio covering customer use cases for on-premises deployment and as a cloud service. The offerings enable organisations to operate Kubernetes and run their modern applications in a cloud-agnostic fashion. Upon completion of the acquisition, Heptio’s Kubernetes solution, expertise and community leadership will enhance the VMware portfolio and further accelerate enterprise adoption of Kubernetes.

“Kubernetes is emerging as an open framework for multi-cloud infrastructure that enables enterprise organizations to run modern applications,” said Paul Fazzone, senior vice president and general manager, Cloud Native Apps Business Unit, VMware. “Heptio products and services will reinforce and extend VMware’s efforts with PKS to establish Kubernetes as the de facto standard for infrastructure across clouds upon closing. We are thrilled that the Heptio team led by Craig and Joe will be joining VMware to help us guide customers as they move to a multi-cloud world.”

“The team at Heptio has been focused on Kubernetes, creating products that make it easier to manage multiple clusters across multiple clouds,” said Craig McLuckie, CEO and co-founder of Heptio. “And now we will be tapping into VMware’s cloud native resources and proven ability to execute, amplifying our impact. VMware’s interest in Heptio is a recognition that there is so much innovation happening in open source. We are jointly committed to contribute even more to the community — resources, ideas and support.”

The transaction is expected to close in VMware’s fiscal Q4 2019, subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals. This acquisition is not expected to have a material impact on fiscal 2019 operating results.
