Moving beyond the boundaries of digital natives, the second edition of the program was aimed at nurturing social impact start-ups creating digital innovations that serve to bring larger sections of new-to-internet/bottom of pyramid users into the digital fold.  
   
As per Nasscom’s internet report, the number of internet users in India will see a two-fold rise at 730 million by 2020 and are expected to take an incredible leap towards internet accessibility.

“*Today, we are witnessing a remarkable growth in the start-up ecosystem, propelled by innovative thinking and attitude to build solutions in key sectors where technology can play a revolutionary role. This is a positive step towards our objective to empower the developer community and motivate large scale innovation impacting bottom of the pyramid. Through the program, we aimed to accelerate the development and adoption of mobile internet applications across India. We would like to thank all our partners for their valuable support and trust and hope to work with a lot more people in the future,*” said **Sangeeta Gupta**, Sr. Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer, Nasscom.

We are excited to support the journeys of these startups and hope that their journeys inspire the next generation of developers to apply their talents to solving these problems,*” said **Satyajeet Singh**, Head of Platform Partnerships, India and South Asia, Facebook.
