The U.S. State Department has made a determination approving a possible Foreign Military Sale to India of 24 MH-60R Multi-Mission helicopters for an estimated cost of $2.6 billion. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency delivered the required certification notifying Congress of this possible sale on April 2, 2019 after the Government of India requested to buy 24 MH-60R Multi-Mission helicopters.

These helicopters will provide India the capability to perform anti-surface and anti-submarine warfare missions along with the ability to perform secondary missions including vertical replenishment, search and rescue, and communications relay.

The principal contractor will be Lockheed Martin Rotary and Mission Systems, Owego, New York. Implementation of this sale will require the assignment of 20–30 U.S. Government and/or contractor representatives to India.

“*This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and national security of the United States by helping to strengthen the U.S.-Indian strategic relationship and to improve the security of a major defensive partner which continues to be an important force for political stability, peace, and economic progress in the Indo-Pacific and South Asia region,*” read a communiqué from the State Department. “*India will use the enhanced capability as a deterrent to regional threats and to strengthen its homeland defense. India will have no difficulty absorbing these helicopters into its armed forces.The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not alter the basic military balance in the region.*”

“*The purchaser typically requests offsets. Any offset agreement will be defined in negotiations between the purchaser and the contractor,*” read the communiqué.
