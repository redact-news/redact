“*This is probably one of the first challenges in the country where Facebook and DSCI is doing an application challenge specifically focused around privacy and some use cases around it,*” said **Rama Vedashree**, CEO, DSCI. “*We’ve actually discovered a lot of use cases with brainstorming and discussions with privacy practitioners, user enterprises, over the last one year. And from that the DSCI team and the Facebook team actually culled out five use cases which are now being opened up for a privacy challenge.*”

Five problem-statements have been identified for the Privacy Challenge : Age Appropriate Design, Privacy Safe Data Sharing Hub, Privacy Notice Communication, Anonymised Data Driven Analytics and Consent Management.

The challenge will be conducted through DSCI’s Use Case Clearing House (UCCH) platform. The submissions for the challenge would be accepted from 25th July to 25th August 2019. Participants are allowed to submit ideas for upto three of the identified problem-statements. A presentation round will be conducted on 9th November 2019 and winners will be announced on 5th December 2019.

The winner gets a cash prize of INR 100,000 and the 1st & 2nd runners-up would get INR 75,000 and INR 50,000 respectively.
