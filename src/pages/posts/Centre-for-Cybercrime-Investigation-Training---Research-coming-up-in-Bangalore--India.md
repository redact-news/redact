The Data Security Council of India (DSCI), Infosys Foundation (the philanthropic arm of Infosys) and the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) of Karnataka Police have inked an MoU to set up the Centre for Cybercrime Investigation Training & Research (CCITR) in Bangalore, Karnataka.

The CCITR will train police, prosecution, judiciary and other departments in handling technology investigations and create standard operating procedures (SOPs) in cybercrime investigations. The center will also be used to perform research in digital forensics and cybercrime investigation that will improve the prosecution of cybercrime cases investigated by the Karnataka Police.

“*DSCI continues its commitment to build the capacity of law enforcement in handling cybercrimes through our Cyber Forensics initiative. The Cybercrime investigation manuals developed by DSCI are acting as reference material for the police, prosecution and judiciary in handling cybercrimes. DSCI is pleased to partner with Infosys Foundation in scaling up the capacity building efforts and setting up the Centre for Cybercrime Investigation Training and Research at CID Headquarters which would enhance the investigation capabilities of Karnataka State Police,*” said **Rama Vedashree**, CEO, Data Security Council of India.

The Infosys Foundation will support the establishment of the Centre that will house the CCITR through a public-private-partnership model, anchored by the Karnataka Police Department.

The foundation will take care of the setup cost and associated facility management and operational costs, including maintenance of equipment and their fittings; capital investment for hardware, software and working capital requirements for conducting training programs, conferences and digital forensic analysis; Technological infrastructure by providing specialized tools and incurring relevant licensing costs; Upgradation of the existing cyber lab for a period of five years.

“*The CCITR is a project for the present and the future; aiming to build state of the art facilities to tackle cyber and forensic crimes in Karnataka. Infosys Foundation is proud to contribute to this project. Once operational, it will be a proud milestone for the CID and the DSCI to curb misuse and unethical use of technology to create distress and uneasiness for fellow beings,*” said **Sudha Murty**, Chairperson, Infosys Foundation.

“*Cyberspace has turned out to be the world’s largest ungoverned space demolishing all geographical boundaries. Crimes using cyberspace will be the biggest organised crime in the times to come. Law enforcement agencies need to proactively get equipped in terms of hardware, software and expertise to face this challenge. I express my sincere gratitude towards Infosys Foundation and Data Security Council of India (DSCI) for coming forward to help the Karnataka State Police in creating a specialized centre for improving the investigation and prosecution of Cybercrimes. This is an excellent example of public-private partnership,*” said **Praveen Sood** IPS, Director General of Police, CID, Karnataka.
