Fly Blade, Inc, a helicopter ride-sharing platform provider, has announced the launch of an Urban Air Mobility (“UAM”) pilot program in India. Blade has formed a Joint Venture (Blade India) with Hunch Ventures, an equity investment firm that has deployed over $100 million in consumer facing business in India, to launch the service.

Former AirAsia CEO **Amar Abrol** has been named CEO of Blade India. Blade India is also partnering with several key Hunch portfolio companies, including *Quintessentially*, a luxury travel concierge in India, and *GoodTimes*, a television network.

“*Given the challenges of building transportation infrastructure in our country, we will utilise India’s existing network of heliports to launch a UAM solution immediately,*” said **Karanpal Singh**, founder of Hunch.

Slated to launch by March 2019, Blade India will transport fliers by helicopters between Blade Lounges being constructed at convenient urban heliports, avoiding large commercial airports entirely as they transform unpredictable four to eight hours drives into short 35-minute flights.

“*India’s major cities are consistently ranked as the most congested in the world,*” said **Rob Wiesenthal**, CEO of Blade. “*By broadening consumers’ access to on-demand aviation, we can start to mitigate these issues today, while building the foundation for Electric Vertical Take-Off and Landing (eVTOL) services tomorrow.*”

“*Blade’s technology, customer experience, and highly-recognised brand give Blade India the backbone it needs to offer a desirable and scalable product,*” said **Abrol**. “*We look forward to working closely with the relevant Indian authorities as we expand our offerings across the country.*”

The company claims to be the largest ‘arranger’ of helicopter flights for civilian travel in the United States.
