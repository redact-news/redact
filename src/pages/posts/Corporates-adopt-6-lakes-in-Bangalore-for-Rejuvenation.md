She spoke of using air quality sensors across the city to get real time data that could be used to make more agile decisions. She said that we need to leverage everything that we have done right to become agile and start developing technology-based leadership in a global sense. “*We are always late to plan. If we need to be agile through the use of technology we must plan now,*” she said.
