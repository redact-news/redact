The company celebrated its twentieth anniversary this month. DEP began operations in 1998 when Radhakrishnan, the company’s Founder and President, released MeshWorks. DEP MeshWorks now is running its 8th major version. Last year the company was awarded a patent for its CAD Morpher technology, that allows users to morph existing CAD data directly to new target shapes without much time & effort from design engineers.

“*At our core, we have engineers who get excited with solving the most difficult of our client’s problems. We thrive on challenge, as it brings out the very best in us and gives us the chance to keep innovating and staying a step ahead,*” states founder **Radhakrishnan**. “*We started in 1998 with just 3 employees, a small room, and a vision to change the way the CAE industry did things. Fast forward twenty years, and we have 8 office locations globally, almost 500 employees and over 100 customers. I am extremely thankful to all of our customers — past and present — for whom we have proudly worked side-by-side to deliver the best. It continues to be an honour and a privilege*”, he added in his 20th Anniversary message.
