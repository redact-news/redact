HAL handed over first three ALHs as part of the 22 ALH MK III contract to the Indian Army during Aero India 2019.

HAL had entered into a contract with the Indian Army for 40 ALH (22 ALH Mk III and 18 Mk IV Rudra) in August 2017. Of the 22 helicopters, 19 helicopters have already been produced and will be progressively delivered.

The documents were handed over to Lt Gen Kanwal Kumar, Director General Army Aviation by Mr GVS Bhaskar Chief Executive Officer, Helicopter Division in the presence of Mr. R Madhavan, CMD, HAL. Officials from the Army, HAL, DGAQA and RCMA were present on the occasion.

The Advanced Light Helicopter (Dhruv) is a multi-role helicopter in the 5.5-ton weight class, powered by two Shakti engines. It is suited for a high-speed cruise for rapid deployment and to maximise the area of operations. The basic helicopter is produced in skid version and wheeled version. In the wheeled version, options for fixed and retractable undercarriages are available.
