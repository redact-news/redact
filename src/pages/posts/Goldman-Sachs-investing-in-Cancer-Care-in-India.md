The private equity arm of US investment banking major Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) along with a consortium of five other investors has invested in **Cytecare Hospitals Private Limited**, which established its flagship hospital in Bangalore, India in 2016 to provide specialised diagnostic and treatment services for cancer.

**Cytecare** today announced the closure of a **$31 million** Series A round, which will be utilized by the company to fund its long term strategy of establishing an **oncology franchise** in four to five cities in India.

“*India, with its large and rapidly growing population, accounts for nearly 20 percent of cancer deaths in the developing world. Cytecare, with its experienced leadership and multi-disciplinary team of clinicians, is positioned to build a nation-wide cancer care network throughout India and address that need in the way we have already done so in Australia, Brazil and China. This investment is also consistent with our strategy to invest in critical sectors and infrastructure that assist in the continued growth and development of India*,” said **Ankur Sahu**, co-head of private equity investing in Asia at **Goldman Sachs** in a statement.

#### Cancer Care — A Profitable Business Model

Interestingly the announcement comes less than two months (April 10th, 2018) after Goldman Sachs released a report that sparked controversy, entitled “**The Genome Revolution,**” in which analysts ask a forthright question “*Is curing patients a sustainable business model?*”

“*… Where an incident pool remains stable (eg, in cancer) the potential for a cure poses less risk to the sustainability of a franchise*,” wrote the analyst.

According to the **International Agency for Research on Cancer**, there will be over 22 million new cases a year by 2030, a significant increase from 14 million in 2012.

“*There will be a 12–15 percent year-on-year growth in cancer incidence in the country over the next 10–12 years*,” said **Suresh Ramu**, Co-founder and CEO, **Cytecare.**

A recent article in the Economist quoted Eric Schmidt of Cowen, an investment firm, saying that **oncology offers the highest returns** on investment of any therapeutic category.

Responding to a question **Dr. Ferzaan Engineer,** Co-founder and Chairman, Cytecare said “*Cytecare is a for-profit hospital. I think there is nothing wrong with it. We need a sustainable and profitable model to keep upgrading infrastructure.*”

#### Goldman Sachs’ Global investments in Oncology

On 26th March 2018, the Merchant Banking Division of Goldman Sachs (**GS MBD**) made a significant capital investment in **Grupo Oncoclínicas**, the largest private cancer treatment group in **Brazil**, making it the majority shareholder.

In May 2017, Goldman Sachs Private Equity teamed up with Queensland Investment Corporation (QIC) and China’s Pagoda to acquire majority stake in **Icon Group** of **Australia** for A$1 Billion.

“*Cytecare will benefit from the global network of class-leading oncology companies that Goldman Sachs is helping build worldwide through the creation of significant opportunities for research, cross-training and sharing of best practices. This partnership and investment adds strategic expertise and financial strength to fuel the next stage of Cytecare’s expansion*,” said **Dr. Ferzaan Engineer**.

**Lavanya Ashok**, Managing Director, Private Equity (PIA) at Goldman Sachs will join Cytecare’s board of directors. Its existing board members and advisors include: Ravi Achar, Shikhar Dharamsey, Vishal Bali, Akila Krishnakumar, Dr Naren Ramakrishnan, Dr Oppel Greeff, John Goodacre, Gillian Corken, Dr Gerard Hoogland and Dr A S Arvind.

Co-founded by Dr. **Ferzaan Engineer** (Chairman), **Suresh Ramu** (CEO) and **Himanshu Shah** (CFO), Cytecare’s plans to create a comprehensive organ-specific oncology platform that supports prevention, treatment and patient-centric care.

Cytecare’s 150-bed hospital has catered to over 5000 patients since it was established in November 2016. In addition to patients from all over India, the hospital has received patients from Africa, Eastern Europe and the Middle East.

#### Cytecare’s Future Plans

Going forward, Cytecare plans to **reach 100,000 cancer patients in India** over a 7 to 8 year period. Cytecare will **invest INR 700 crore** on the oncology platform over the next 4–5 years. The company is targeting **annual revenues of over 1000 crores** in its mature years (7–8 years from now).

The expansion will be a replication of the hub and spoke model that the company is establishing in Bangalore. Cytecare already has an arrangement to conduct screening camps in Hassan, nearly 200 km away from Bangalore.

A few days back, on the occassion of World No Tobacco Day, Dr Vikram Kekatpure, Senior Consultant, Head and Neck Surgical Oncology had said that Cytecare plans to set up an **Information Hub in Kolkata**.

“*We are currently in the process of identifying new cities to execute our hub-and-spoke growth strategy*,” said **Suresh Ramu.** The infrastructure-heavy hub will be a centre of excellence for research and innovation. “*We are currently creating a set of criteria to evaluate cities to expand. There will be a bias for larger cities.*”

“*Hari Menon (a Haemato Oncology Specialist from the Tata Memorial Centre)is one of twenty-four oncologists in the centre. This is the largest concentration of oncologists in one centre*,” said Suresh Ramu. “*Our organ-site focussed treatments will make a world of difference in patient outcomes. We are also focussing on advanced diagnostics and genomic therapy.*”

“*We have already enrolled with 14 to 15 insurance comapnies. I am happy to see a lot of well-insured people coming in*,” said **Dr.** **Ferzaan Engineer.**

“*Through our partnership with Goldman Sachs and their strong global network and large portfolio in healthcare and insurance companies across the world, we will be able to fully realize our goal of creating a new benchmark for cancer treatment and care in India*,” said **Suresh Ramu.**
