KYMCO (Kwang Yang Motor Co), a Taiwanese manufacturer of scooters, motorcycles, and ATVs, has announced its official entry into the Indian market with its Ionex electric scooter solution. The company has partnered with an Indian company — Twenty Two Motors — for the purpose.

With this alliance, Twenty Two Motors Pvt. Ltd, a Haryana-based electric scooter startup, will equip its EV models with Ionex technology. The first Ionex model, FLOW, will be available in the market in early 2019.

Kymco is expected to invest $65 million in Twenty Two Motors over the next three years. Twenty Two Motors was co-founded by Parveen Kharb and Vijay Chandrawat in 2016. The company will utilise the funds to set up a manufacturing facility for the scooters and to localise the batteries.

Twenty Two Motors will also develop the Ionex energy network in major cities across the country.

“*We believe we are at the junction of the most important transformation of personal transportation. With Ionex, we see a promising future for electric vehicles in India. We want to create a ground-breaking electric scooter segment. We have the determination and capability to promote the green movement in India that celebrates one of the most important social missions of our time,*” **Allen Ko**, Chairman, KYMCO.

The Indian government is actively promoting green movement through policies that encourage the use of electric vehicles as well as the establishment of EV infrastructure. The latest ‘National E-Mobility Programme’ aims to shift one third of petrol and diesel vehicles to electric by 2030.
