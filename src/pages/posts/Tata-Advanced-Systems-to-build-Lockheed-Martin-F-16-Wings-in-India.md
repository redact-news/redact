Lockheed Martin Corp. \[*NYSE: LMT*\] and Tata Advanced Systems Limited (TASL) have entered into an agreement to commence production of F-16 wings in India for export. TASL will become the global provider of wings for all future customers of the F-16.

“*The planned F-16 wing production move to India is not contingent on the Government of India selecting the F-16 for the Indian Air Force,*” the company said in a statement. Lockheed is vying for a mega-order of F-16s from India which wants to replace its ageing fleet of MiG 21s.

Lockheed Martin and TASL announced last year that the two companies intend to join hands to produce the F-16 Block 70 in India if the aircraft is selected by the Indian Air Force.

To date, 4,604 F-16s have been procured by 28 customers around the world. Approximately 3,000 operational F-16s are flying today with 25 air forces, including the U.S. Air Force. Several of these are expected to be upgraded to the Block-70 standard over a period of time. In the U.S. alone the F-16 supply chain has around 450 suppliers across 42 states.

“*The production of the F-16 wings in India, for global application, is set to place the country at the centre of the world's largest fighter aircraft ecosystem and make it a preferred destination for aerospace manufacturing,*” said **Sukaran Singh**, Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director, Tata Advanced Systems. “*TASL and Lockheed Martin, through a long-standing joint-venture, have been manufacturing airframe components of the C-130J aircraft and S-92 Sikorsky helicopter at the Hyderabad facility. This development now again gives us an excellent opportunity to showcase our technological expertise and advance our capability development, as we reinforce our commitment to both the Indian and global aerospace industry.*”

The F-16 Block 70 features an upgraded airframe with 12,000 hours of extended structural service life. The wings are made of composites produced through a co-curing process.

“*Building F-16 wings in India is a natural next step that builds on our successful partnerships with Tata on the C-130J \[airlifter\] and S-92 \[helicopter\],*” said **Vivek Lall**, Vice President of Strategy and Business Development for Lockheed Martin Aeronautics. “*This is a strategic business decision that reflects the value of our partnerships with India and the confidence we have in Tata to perform advanced defence manufacturing work and deliver world-class products.*”

Earlier, Lockheed Martin had announced plans to shift its entire F-16 assembly line from Texas to India in addition to making India its global F-16 spares hub and modernisation centre, however this proposal lost steam after the Trump administration took office.

“*Lockheed Martin’s broader proposed F-16 partnership with India — to produce F-16s exclusively in India for the Indian Air Force and export customers — stands firm. Lockheed Martin recently submitted a comprehensive, fully compliant 600-plus page Request for Information (RFI) response to the Indian Air Force,*” the company said in a statement.

This announcement by the companies comes just two days before the scheduled 2+2 dialogue between India and the U.S., where both countries are expected to finalise a number of defence agreements.

Tata Advanced Systems Limited is a manufacturing partner for global OEMs, including Boeing, Airbus Group, Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation, Lockheed Martin Aeronautics, Pilatus Aircraft Ltd, Cobham Mission Equipment, as well as the Government of India’s Defence Research & Development Organisation.
