Tata Lockheed Martin Aerostructures Limited (TLMAL) recently delivered the 100th C-130J Super Hercules empennage from its manufacturing facility located in Hyderabad, India. TLMAL is the single global source of C-130J empennage assemblies that are installed on all new Super Hercules aircraft produced in Marietta, Georgia, in the United States.

Empennage assemblies produced by TLMAL include the aircraft’s horizontal and vertical stabilizers along with leading edges and tip assemblies. The TLMAL team also previously manufactured sets of C-130J center wing box components, and introduced a new cutting-edge 4,700 square-meter metal-to-metal bonding facility in May 2018. TLMAL currently employs 500 people.

“*The delivery milestone highlights the ongoing success of Lockheed Martin’s hallmark Make in India partnership with Tata,*” read a communiqué from the company.

TLMAL — a joint venture between Tata Advanced Systems Limited (TASL) and Lockheed Martin Aeronautics \[NYSE: LMT\] — was established in 2010 in Hyderabad.

“*It is a moment of great pride and honor for TLMAL, as it delivers the100th empennage. The joint venture has been a great example of successful U.S ̶ India Industrial partnership and a testimony to Lockheed Martin’s and Tata’s intent of developing aerospace manufacturing in India,*” said **Sukaran Singh**, chief executive officer and managing director, TASL. “*I congratulate the operations team that has ensured all deliveries ahead of schedule that will go a long way in extending our partnership to a new level with Lockheed Martin.*”

“*TLMAL empennages have been included in C-130Js that have supported critical worldwide search and rescue, peacekeeping, combat delivery, maritime patrol, special operations, aerial refuelling, medevac and humanitarian response missions. TLMAL empennages are also included in the LM-100J ─ the commercial variant of the Super Hercules,*” read a communiqué from the company.

“*The C-130J has a global presence both in its operations as well as within its core structure, as exemplified by its TLMAL-built empennage,*” said **Karmyn Norwoo**d, vice president of International Programs for Air Mobility & Maritime Missions at Lockheed Martin. “*I’ve been privileged to watch our TLMAL partnership grow significantly in terms of capability over the past few years. This growth is due, in large part, to the outstanding team that builds these empennages. This team’s pride and commitment to quality is built into each and every empennage!*”
