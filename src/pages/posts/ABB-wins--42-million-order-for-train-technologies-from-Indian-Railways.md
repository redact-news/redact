ABB (ABBN: SIX Swiss Ex) has won its largest traction equipment order in India, worth more than $42 million to supply converters for electric locomotives from Diesel Locomotive Works (DLW), in Varanasi. The converters are custom designed for Indian Railways and will be manufactured at one of ABB’s largest factories for locomotive applications in Nelamangala, near Bangalore, in Southern India.

Today India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi flagged off the first diesel to electric locomotive conversion project — WAGC3 : 10,000 HP at the Diesel Locomotive Works in Varanasi. From concept to execution, the project was completed at DLW in 69 days (22 December 2017 to 28 February 2018). The conversion cost of each locomotive is less than the mid-life rehabilitation of a diesel locomotive. The converted electric locomotive delivers 10,000 HP against 2 x 2612 HP of 2 diesel locomotives (92 % more power). Ten thousand HP of haulage power is adequate to haul a load up to around 5300 tonnes, providing about 2:1 horsepower to trailing load ratio. This also leads to an increase in average speeds of freight trains. Sanction for commercial services was issued on 27th of November 2018.

ABB’s traction solution is based on the latest technology to bring more reliable trains to passengers, while increasing sustainable transport use by moving from diesel trains to electric. This helps rail operators to achieve significant operational improvements.

“*We are delighted to be contributing to the electrification of India’s rail network with ABB’s locally manufactured solutions,*” said ABB CEO **Ulrich Spiesshofer**. “*By adopting advanced technologies, India is achieving rapid improvements in growth and productivity and shaping its economy for the era of digitalization.*”

“*We are privileged to work with DLW and Indian Railways on the electrification of the domestic rail network in India — the fourth largest rail network in the world,*” said **Sanjeev Sharma**, Managing Director, ABB India. “*This order will help to improve rail efficiency, so that passengers travelling in India will reach their destination on time and in comfort.*”

Today, ABB traction equipment successfully drives more than 250 electric locomotives operated by Indian Railways for both passenger and freight services. In India, more than 20 percent of three-phase electric locomotives are equipped with traction converters from ABB. Last year, the Indian government approved plans to fully electrify the Indian Railways by 2022.
