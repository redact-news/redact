Avanturaa Choppers, after recently receiving ARAI certification for its maiden models, has announced the opening of its first showroom in Bangalore. The Rudra and Pravega will now be available for customers to test and purchase from ‘*The Driven Café*’.

Both bikes have been designed by **Kevin Alsop**, the  founder of Big Bear Choppers, USA.

“*There has been a long-term trend of modifying existing bikes to look like choppers. We are the first company that is part of the automobile industry,*” said **Amitabh Biswas**, Co-Founder & Chief Marketing Officer.

A chopper is a type of custom motorcycle which emerged in California in the late 1950s and went on to become a popular trend. Some of the characteristic features of choppers are long front ends with extended forks often coupled with an increased rake angle, hardtail frames, very tall or very short handlebars, lengthened or stretched frames, and larger than stock front wheels.

The name ‘*Avanturaa*’ is a portmanteau word coined by the fusion of two Sanskrit words : *Avnendra* which means king of the earth and *Tura* which means speedy or swift.

“*With the launch of our showroom in Bangalore, soon to be followed by other key markets, the realization of our ambition to create a Global impact from India, has begun. The growing culture of leisure-riding in India and the number of connoisseurs pioneering it, give us confidence that the market is ready for Avanturaa Choppers,*” said **Gaurav A. Aggarwal**, CEO of Avanturaa Choppers.

“*We hope to sell three to four bikes per month from this dealership. This year we are targeting sales of 35 to 40 bikes*,” said **Vijay Singh**, Co-founder & Chief Revenue Officer. “*We will have a servicing workshop here. We are also working out the modalities for doorstep service of the bike,*” he added.

The company will soon open its dealership in Hyderabad, followed by one in Delhi NCR and another one by December.

Avanturaa Choppers claims to be the fifth Indian motorcycle manufacturer to be registered in the country after a period of 33 years. According to Amitabh Biswas, the last Indian motorcycle company was registered in the year 1984 (Hero Moto Corp erstwhile Hero Honda).

Due to several incremental changes, it took nearly a year and a half for Avanturaa Choppers to finally get the ARAI (*Automotive Research Association of India*) certification.

Avanturaa Choppers set up its 10,000sq.ft. manufacturing facility, with an investment of Rs. 20 crores at Vasai, which is around 40km from Mumbai. The facility can manufacture upto 400 bikes a year. The company currently employs 25 people and can manufacture 10 bikes a month.

All the fabrication work is done in India. The moulds, jigs and fixtures were imported by the company from the US. The bikes are 30 percent localised and the rest is imported. The chassis, fuel-tank and wheels are produced in India. The chassis itself is crafted out of 25 to 30 smaller parts. “*Most of the parts are made from aluminium, mild-steel or stainless-steel. We have avoided plastics and brass. We use a self-healing lacquer for the paint-work,*” said Gaurav A. Aggarwal, CEO of Avanturaa Choppers.
