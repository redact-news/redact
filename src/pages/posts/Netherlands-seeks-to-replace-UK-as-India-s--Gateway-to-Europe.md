Dutch  Prime Minister **Mark Rutte** will pay a state visit to India from 24th-25th May. A delegation of officials, companies and institutions from the Netherlands will be in India from 22nd-25th May, visiting the cities of Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore.

PM Rutte and India’s Prime Minister **Narendra Modi** will discuss the role of Netherlands as India’s Gateway to Europe. Negotiations on stalled **free trade agreement** between India and the European Union will also take place.

<figcaption>The Netherlands is being positioned as India’s “Gateway to&nbsp;Europe.”</figcaption>

In the backdrop of an ever imminent **BREXIT** there is a race among European nations to become India’s new “***Gateway to Europe.***”

The Netherlands, with its port in **Rotterdam**, is the largest maritime freight transport country in Europe, followed by Antwerpen and Hamburg. Twenty percent of India’s exports to Europe pass through Netherlands. In this context it could very well be seen as India’s “Gateway to Europe.” PM Rutte’s visit to India comes within a year of Indian Prime Minister, Narendra Modi’s visit to the Netherlands on 27 June, 2017.

While the prospective withdrawal of the United Kingdom (UK) from the European Union (EU) is held in abeyance, the **competition for the sobriquet**, “*Gateway to Europe*”, could be perceived as a *carrot and stick* to nudge the UK to remain in the EU or prolong its lingering. After all, just 51.9% of the participating UK electorate voted to leave the EU in a referendum on 23 June 2016.

The Netherlands is also home to a 235,000 strong Indian Diaspora, the largest in mainland Europe.

Netherlands is the fifth largest investor in India, with 83 percent constituting routed flows (CBGA 2017).

Several transnational companies base their global trade and investment operations in the jurisdiction of the Netherlands due to its favourable tax regime that facilitates corporate tax avoidance strategies.

A report by the Centre for Research on Multinational Corporations (SOMO) entitled  “*Dutch Bilateral Investment Treaties — A gateway to ‘treaty shopping’ for investment protection by multinational companies*” finds that a majority of companies availing themselves of the generous investment protections offered by Dutch BITs are so-called ‘mailbox companies’ with no employees on their payroll and no real economic activity in the Netherlands.

**Vodafone** had, in April 2017, invoked the **India-Netherlands BIT** and filed a claim against the government of India, challenging its retrospective tax amendment which led to a taxation of Rs 11,000 crore plus interest against Vodafone on its 2007 acquisition of a 67% stake in Hutch-Essar in India.

The Netherlands and India have historical relations going back to the early 17th century. The **Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie (VOC)**\[1602–1799\], better known as the *Dutch East India Company* was the first corporation to be ever actually listed on an official stock exchange. The company is often considered the world’s first true transnational corporation.
